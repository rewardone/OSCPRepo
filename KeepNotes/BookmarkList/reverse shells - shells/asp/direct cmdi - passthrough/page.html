</head><body>Rarely do will you encounter ASP applications that directly run commands on the system, but when you do, the first thing to try is to execute your own commands. Since ASP almost always runs on IIS / windows, assume you're working with a dos shell. Referring back to our web shell, we know what the code looks like to execute commands. That being said if wee control any part of the variable being executed, we might be able to execute our own stuff. Example:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;%<br/>
Set command = "rundll32.exe /d " + "Request.QueryString("lol") + ".dll"<br/>
Set objWShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")<br/>
objWShell.Exec(command)<br/>
%&gt; <br/>
<br/>
In this case, we control part of what is being executed in the string. How could we exploit &nbsp;it? We could use the semi colon character to add the current command within the same execution. Normally, when you pass a command to a dos shell it executes things one at a time. Passing a semicolon allows you to have more than 1 command in the process's execution screen. So the exploitable URL would look like this:<br/>
&nbsp;http://www.example.com/hithere.asp?lol=user32;IISRESET;<br/>
<br/>
This will reset the IIS server, annoying when you're an admin and have to turn it back on. Also in case you are wondering why I'm only using GET variables, its because they're easier to show example URLs for. In ASP, a POST'd variable is obtained via request.form(). </body></html>
