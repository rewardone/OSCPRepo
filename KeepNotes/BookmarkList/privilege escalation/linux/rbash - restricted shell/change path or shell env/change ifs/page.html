<title>Change IFS</title>
</head><body>1a. Using the systems predictable temporary files, expreserve and the IFS.<br/>
<br/>
This hack has been around forever, and still comes back every once and a while. The breakout basically consists of the user setting the IFS (Internal Field Separator, which is normally a space, tab or newline) and then using an editor to execute files in his/her local directory using the "preserve" function of vi. It's only really a trivial hack if the system is setup improperly.<br/>
<br/>
Example below, with the assumption that "[esc]:pre" uses /bin/mail to notify the user of a vi crash.<br/>
<br/>
rbash # touch bin mail &lt;--- These files would be edited to include bad commands and made executable<br/>
rbash # chmod 777 bin mail<br/>
rbash # export IFS="/"<br/>
rbash # vi<br/>
[esc]:pre<br/>
File preserved.<br/>
[esc]:q!<br/>
<br/>
Now, when the [esc]:pre function runs /bin/mail, it would (theoretically) be running "bin" and "mail" in the user's home directory, since he/she changed the IFS to "/".</body></html>
