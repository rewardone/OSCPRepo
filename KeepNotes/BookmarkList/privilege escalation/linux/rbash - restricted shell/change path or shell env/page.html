<br/>
Type 'export -p' to see the exported variables in the shell. What this will also show you is which variables are read-only. You'll note that most likely the PATH and SHELL variables are '-rx', which means you execute them, but not write to them. If they are writeable, then you can start giggling now as you'll be able to escape the restricted shell in no time! If the SHELL variable is writeable, you can simply set it to your shell of choice (i.e. sh, bash, ksh, etc...). If the PATH is writeable, then you'll be able to set it to any directory you want. I recommend setting it to one that has commands vulnerable to shell escapes.<br/>
<br/>
export PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH<br/>
export SHELL=/bin/sh<br/>
export SHELL=/bin/bash<br/>
(within vi) set shell=/bin/bash:shell<br/>
