</head><body>Stores &lt;connectionStrings&gt; elements that include database credentials<br/>
Credentials can be stored in clear-text or encrypted via Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI)<br/>
DPAPI uses either Machine-Level or User-Level encryption keys (AKA key containers)<br/>
Low-priv users do not have access to Machine-Level key containers by default<br/>
Decryption is possible by low-priv users if they were granted permissions to access the key container that was used to encrypt<br/>
