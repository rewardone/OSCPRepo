<title>Mitigations</title>
</head><body>&nbsp;FireEye recommends the following mitigation techniques when loading updated DLLs for packaging: <br/>
• Ensure that the full path is hardcoded. Avoid using relative paths for any resources. <br/>
• Confirm that the imported DLL actually exists. <br/>
• Ensure that imported functions are valid. As noted from the PlugX sample, the spoofed function was simply empty. <br/>
• Ensure that the operating system is correct. <br/>
• Utilize DLL redirection or a manifest. Recent versions of Visual Studio enable developers to create manifests to ensure that the loaded library is valid.</body></html>
