<title>Executing the DLL</title>
</head><body>At this point we have our DLL in memory and we know the memory address we'd like to start execution at. All that's really left is to tell our process to execute it. There are a couple of ways to do this. <br/>
<br/>
<b>CreateRemoteThread()</b><br/>
The <a href="dwReflectiveLoaderOffset = GetReflectiveLoaderOffset(lpWriteBuff);">CreateRemoteThread</a>() function is probably the most widely known and used method. It's very reliable and works most times; hwoever, you may want to use another method to avoid detection or if Microsoft changes something to cause CreateRemoteThread() to stop working. <br/>
<br/>
Since CreateRemoteThread() is a very established function, you have a greater flexibility in how you use it. For instance, you can do things like use Python to do DLL injection. <br/>
rThread = CreateRemoteThread(hTargetProcHandle, NULL, 0, lpStartExecAddr, lpExecParam, 0, NULL); WaitForSingleObject(rThread, INFINITE); &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
<b>NtCreateThreadEx()</b><br/>
NtCreateThreadEx() is an undocumented ntdll.dll function. The trouble with undocumented functions is that they may disappear or change at any moment Microsoft decides. That being said, NtCreateThreadEx() came in good handy when Windows Vista+ session separation affected CreateRemoteThread() DLL Injection. <br/>
Detailed information about this method described here: <a href="http://securityxploded.com/ntcreatethreadex.php">SecurityXploded</a><br/>
<br/>
NtCreateThreadEx() is a bit more complicated to call, we'll need a specific structure to apss to it and another to receive data rfrom it. An example implementation is in the child page. <br/>
<br/>
With the example code, we can call it very much like CreateRemoteThread()<br/>
rThread = bCreateRemoteThread(hTargetProcHandle, lpStartExecAddr, lpExecParam); WaitForSingleObject(rThread, INFINITE); &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
<b>Suspend, Inject, and Resume</b><br/>
SIR is an unofficial term to describe the method of injecting into process by attaching to it, suspending it and all of its threads, targeting a particular thread, saving the current registers, changing the instructino pointer to point to your executing starting point, and resuming the thread. This is a much more intrusive method, but works reliably and does not dpend on additional function calls. <br/>
<br/>
This method is a little more involved to implement. There is a great write up <a href="http://syprog.blogspot.com/2012/05/createremotethread-bypass-windows.html">here</a>:<br/>
