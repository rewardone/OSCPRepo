<title>Session Separation</title>
</head><body>Things have changed in CreateRemoteThread due to a new feature in Vista: Session Separation. Session Separation ensures that core system processes included services always run in session 0 while all user processes run in different sessions. As a result, any process running in user session failed to inject DLL into system process as CreateRemoteThread did not work across session boundaries. <br/>
