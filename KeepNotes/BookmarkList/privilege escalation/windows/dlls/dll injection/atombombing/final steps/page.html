<title>Final Steps</title>
</head><body>How do we proceed from here? I have worked it out and at this point, I’d rather leave this as an exercise to the reader. As an initial hint, I suggest you take a look at my previous blog post (<a href="http://breakingmalware.com/documentation/documenting-undocumented-adding-control-flow-guard-exceptions/">http://breakingmalware.com/documentation/documenting-undocumented-adding-control-flow-guard-exceptions/</a>). I’m sure you’ll also find creative ideas, that I myself haven’t found, to handle this problem and I’d be happy to start this discussion.<br/>

You can use the comments below or catch me <a href="https://twitter.com/Tal_Liberman">@tal_liberman</a>. Through Twitter, I’ll also release some tidbits throughout the week. At any rate, I will publish my solution next week.<br/>
