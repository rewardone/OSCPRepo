ClobalAddAtom: Adds a character string to the global atom table and returns a unique value (an atom) identifying the string <br/>
GlobalGetAtomName: Retrieves a copy of the character string associated with the specified global atom<br/>
<br/>
By calling GlobalAddAtom one can store a null terminated buffer in the global atom table. This table is accessible from every other process on the system. The buffer can then be retreived by calling GlobalGetAtomName. GlobalGetAtomName expects a pointer to an output buffer, so the caller chooses where the null terminated buffer will be stored. <br/>
<br/>
In theory, if I could add a buffer containing shellcode to the global atom table by calling GlobalAddAtom, and then somehow get the target process to call GlobalGetAtomName I could copy code from my process to the target process, without calling WriteProcessMemory.<br/>
<br/>
Calling GlobalAddAtom from my process is pretty straightforward, but how would I get the target process to call GlobalGetAtomName?<br/>
<br/>
By using Async Procedure Calls (APC):<br/>
<br/>
QueueUserApc – adds a user-mode asynchronous procedure call (APC) object to the APC queue of the specified thread.<br/>
DWORD WINAPI QueueUserAPC(<br/>
_In_ PAPCFUNC &nbsp;pfnAPC, <br/>
_In_ HANDLE &nbsp; &nbsp;hThread, <br/>
_In_ ULONG_PTR dwData<br/>
);<br/>
<br/>
QueueUserApc receives a pointer to an APCProc which is defined as follows:<br/>
VOID CALLBACK APCProc(<br/>
&nbsp; _In_ ULONG_PTR dwParam<br/>
);<br/>
<br/>
GlobalGetAtomName’s prototype is:<br/>
UINT WINAPI GlobalGetAtomName( &nbsp;<br/>
_In_ &nbsp;ATOM &nbsp; nAtom, &nbsp;<br/>
_Out_ LPTSTR lpBuffer, &nbsp;<br/>
_In_ &nbsp;int &nbsp; &nbsp;nSize<br/>
);<br/>
<br/>
Since GlobalGetAtomName expects 3 parameters (while  APCProc is defined to expect only 1 parameter) we can’t use QueueUserApc to get the target process to call GlobalGetAtomName.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Let’s take a look at the internals of QueueUserApc:<br/>
<br/>
As you can see QueueUserApc uses the undocumented NtQueueApcThread syscall in order to add the APC to the target thread’s APC queue.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Interestingly enough NtQueueApcThread receives a pointer to a function that is to be called asynchronously in the target thread, but the function being passed is not the original APCProc function the caller passed to QueueUserApc. Instead the function being passed is ntdll!RtlDispatchAPC, and the original APCProc function passed to QueueUserApc is passed as a parameter to ntdll!RtlDispatchAPC.<br/>
<br/>
It starts by checking if the 3rd parameter is valid, which means an ActivationContext needs to be activated before dispatching the APC.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
If an ActivationContext needs to be activated:<br/>
<br/>
The function ntdll!RtlDispatchAPC executes the following:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>The passed ActivationContext (currently in ESI) will be activated by calling RtlActivateActivationContextUnsafeFast.</li>
<li>The parameter to the original APCProc function (i.e. the third parameter passed to QueueUserApc) is pushed onto the stack. This is because we are about to call the original APCProc function.</li>
<li>Right before dispatching the APC, a call to CFG (__guard_check_icall_fptr) is made to make sure the APC target is a CFG valid function.</li>
<li>A call to the original APCProc is made, and that’s it – the APC has been dispatched.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Once APCProc returns, the activation context is deactivated:<br/>
<br/>
If, on the other hand, no activation context needs to be activated:<br/>
<br/>
The code skips all the activation context related stuff and simply dispatches the APC right away after calling CFG.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
What does all this mean? When calling QueueUserApc we are forced to pass an APCProc which expects one parameter. However, under the hood QueueUserApc uses NtQueueApcThread to call ntdll!RtlDispatchAPC which expects 3 parameters.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
What was our goal? To call GlobalGetAtomName. How many parameters does it expect? 3. Can we do this? Yes. How? NtQueueApcThread!<br/>
