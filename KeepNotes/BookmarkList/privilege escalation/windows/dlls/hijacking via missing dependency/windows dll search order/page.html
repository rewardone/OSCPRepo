<title>Windows DLL Search Order</title>
</head><body>Generally a Windows application will use pre-defined search paths to find DLL's and it will check these paths in a specific order. DLL hijacking usually happens by placing a malicious DLL in one of these paths while making sure that DLL is found before the legitimate one. This problem can be mitigated by having the application specify absolute paths to the DLL's that it needs.<br/>
<br/>
You can see the DLL search order on 32-bit systems below:<br/>
1 - The directory from which the application loaded<br/>
2 - 32-bit System directory (C:\Windows\System32) (use GetSystemDirectory to get this)<br/>
3 - 16-bit System directory (C:\Windows\System)<br/>
4 - Windows directory (C:\Windows) (use GetWindowsDirectory to get this)<br/>
5 - The current working directory (CWD)<br/>
6 - Directories in the PATH environment variable (system then user)(Note: does not include App Paths registry key)<br/>
<br/>
Note the Current Working Directory position may change or even NOT on the list!<br/>

<br/>
Factors That Affect Searching<ul><li>If a DLL with the same module name is already loaded in memory, the system checks <b>only for redirection and a manifest</b>&nbsp;before resolving to the loaded DLL, no matter which directory it is in. <b>The system does not search for the DLL</b>.</li>
<li>If the DLL is on the list of known DLLs for the version of Windows on which the application is running, <b>the system uses its copy</b>&nbsp;of the known DLL (and the known DLL's dependent DLLs, if any) <b>instead of searching</b>&nbsp;for the DLL. For a list of known DLLs on the current system, see the following registry key: <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\KnownDLLs</b>.</li>
<li>If a DLL has dependencies, the system<b>&nbsp;searches for the dependent DLLs</b>&nbsp;as if they were loaded with<b>&nbsp;just their module names</b>. This is true even if the first DLL was loaded by specifying a full path.</li>
</ul>
