<title>Via New-Win32Process</title>
</head><body>Normally in the UAC case you specify an explicit token to assign to the new process. However, if you don’t specify a token the new process will inherit from the assigned parent, the only requirement for this is the handle to the process we use as a parent must have the PROCESS_CREATE_PROCESS access right. As we’ve got SeDebugPrivilege we can get full access to the TI process including the right to create new child processes from it. As an added bonus the kernel process creation code will even assign the correct session ID for the caller so we can create interactive processes. We exploit this behavior to create an arbitrary process running as the TI service token on the current desktop using the New-Win32Process cmdlet and passing the process object in the -ParentProcess parameter.<br/>
