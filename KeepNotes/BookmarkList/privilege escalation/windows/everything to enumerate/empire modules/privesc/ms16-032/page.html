MS16-032 Bulletin: Security Update for Secondary Logon to Address Elevation of Privilege<br/>
Vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege if the Windows Secondary Logon Service fails to properly manage request handles in memory. <br/>
Secondary Logon service is present on all modern versions of Windows, at least back to XP. Exposes an RPC endpoint that allows a normal process to create new processes with different tokens. Exposed through CreateProcessWithTokenW and CreateProcessWithLogonW APIs. <br/>
We spin up a thread which will repeatedly set the system impersonation token to the leaked thread handle. In another thread we call CreateProcessWithLogon until the new process that’s created has the privileged token. We can determine whether a privileged token has been used by just inspecting the primary token. By default we won’t be able to open the token at all, so if we get ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED, we know we’ve succeeded.<br/>
