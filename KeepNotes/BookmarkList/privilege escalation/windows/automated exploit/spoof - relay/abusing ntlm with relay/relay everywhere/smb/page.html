Relaying to SMB is the classic attack, which was already part of smbrelayx. If you are unfamiliar with this attack, relaying to SMB allows attackers to execute files on hosts that have SMB signing disabled if the user being relayed has administrative privileges on the box. For non-administrative users, ntlmrelayx adds the option to launch a smbclient shell, which allows attackers to interact with shares, for example to download or upload files. This attack can be done with the interactive flag (-i), which will spawn a local TCP shell, which can be connected to with for example netcat.</body></html>
