</head><body>Relaying to IMAP<br/>
While not enabled by default in modern versions of Exchange, many organizations support NTLM authentication via IMAP on their exchange server. This allows for relaying to IMAP, giving an attacker direct access to emails of the victim. When relaying to IMAP, ntlmrelayx has the option to search for keywords in emails, or to just download all the latest emails in a specified inbox of the user.</body></html>
