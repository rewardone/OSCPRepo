User Account Control (UAC) gives us the ability to run in standard user rights instead of full administrator rights. So even if your standard user account is in the local admin group damage is limited, i.e. installing services, drivers, writing to secure locations, etc. are denied. To carry out these actions users would need to interact with the desktop such us right click and run as administrator or accept the UAC elevation prompt. UAC was introduced from Windows Vista onwards and contains a number of technologies that include file system and registry virtualization, the Protected Administrator (PA) account, UAC elevation prompts and Windows Integrity levels.<br/>
<br/>
In Windows Vista and later, processes run at three different levels of integrity: high, medium, and low. A high integrity process has administrator rights. A medium integrity process is one that runs with standard user rights. A low integrity process is very restricted. Most desktop applications run in a medium integrity process, even if the current user is a local administrator. Use Process Explorer to see which Integrity level your programs are running at.<br/>
<ul><li>Mandatory Label\High Mandatory Level. This means I have administrator rights.</li>
<li>Mandatory Label\Medium Mandatory Level. This means I have standard user rights.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Auto-Elevate</b><br/>
If requirements are right and the process posesses the 'auto-elevate' property in their manifest file, then the program will execute with Administrator permissions. The binaries with this property should always be Microsoft signed binaries as well. The logic is that since they are signed and the user executing the binary is an admin (or part of an admin group) that Windows can silently auto-elevate and run with higher integrity. UAC Bypass looks for the binaries that posess this property and attempt to abuse them to execute without a user prompt. This is also why UAC bypass is not effective and cannot be used against a UAC setting like "Always Notify", but what corp sets that? <br/>
<br/>
<b>RunAs</b><br/>
Simply runAs Administrator and ask the user to accept. Most executables can use ShellExecute and pass the 'runas' verb<br/>
<br/>
The Metasploit Framework’s exploit/windows/local/ask module by mubix implements this attack for you. Make sure you set EXE::Custom to avoid anti-virus!<br/>
<br/>
PowershellEmpire has an "Ask User" module as well<br/>
<br/>
<b>Actual UAC Bypass</b><br/>
The RunAs option prompts the user and that’s an opportunity to get caught. We want a way to spawn a high integrity process from a medium integrity process without a prompt. Fortunately, there is a way to do this, it’s the bypass UAC attack.<br/>
They also released the exploit/windows/local/bypassuac MSF module that uses Leo’s proof-of-concept for the heavy lifting.<br/>
<br/>
The bypass UAC attack <b>requires that UAC is set to the default</b>:<ul><li>Notify me only when apps try to make changes to my computer (default)</li>
<li>Notify me only when apps try to make changes to my computer (do not dim desktop settings)</li>
</ul>
If UAC is set to <b>Always Notify</b>, this attack will <b>not</b>&nbsp;work. This attack also <b>requires that our current user is in an administrators group.</b><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Primer Example</b><br/>
We get code execution through DLL search order hijacking. The public versions of the bypass UAC attack copy a CRYPTBASE.dll file to c:\windows\system32\sysprep and run c:\windows\system32\sysprep.exe. When sysprep.exe runs it will search for CRYPTBASE.dll and find the malicious one first.<br/>
<br/>
Because sysprep.exe automatically runs in a high integrity context (when UAC is set to default), the code in the attacker controlled CRYPTBASE.dll will execute in this high integrity context too. From there, we’re free to do whatever we like. We have our administrator privileges.<br/>
<br/>
A recent addition to the Metasploit Framework is the <b>exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_inject</b>&nbsp;module. &nbsp;This module compiles the UAC bypass logic into a reflective DLL. It spawns a Microsoft-signed program and injects the UAC bypass logic directly into it. The only thing that needs to touch disk is the CRYPTBASE.dll file.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Lateral Movement and UAC</b><br/>
The concept of process integrity level only applies to the current system. When you interact with a network resource, your access token is all that matters. If your current user is a domain user and your domain user is a local administrator on another system, you can get past UAC. Here’s how this works:<br/>
<br/>
You may use your token to interact with another system as an administrator. This means you may copy an executable to that other system and schedule it to run. If you get access to another system this way, you may repeat the same process to regain access to your current system with full rights.<br/>
<br/>
You may use the Metasploit Framework’s exploit/windows/local/current_user_psexec to do this.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Execution note</b><br/>
Basically all a fileless bypass means is it doesn't rely on the old <i>IFileOperation </i>tricks to hijack a DLL. Doesn't mean that at no point would some file end on disk somewhere, I suppose it's more a DFIR kind of term. Anyway enough, on to technical content.</body></html>
