<title>Creating A Profile</title>
</head><body>How we can create these profiles and how they are installed. <br/>
After some reading I found out that CMAK (Connection Manager Administration Kit) is a Windows feature so I went ahead and enabled it. It is called RAS Connection Manager Adminstration Kit (CMAK)<br/>
After starting CMAK you are presented to wizard. The wizard allows you to create profiles that can be used by CMSTP. <br/>

<br/>
The files are now located in that path showed in the wizard. In my case this is:<br/>
C:\Program Files\CMAK\Profiles\Windows Vista and above\CorpVPN\<br/>
It should create the .cmp, .cms, .inf, .exe, and .sed<br/>
The .exe and .sed are actually IEXPRESS (a binary used to create an “installer” in Windows) files. They can be ignored.<br/>
