<title>SilentCleanup</title>
</head><body>The reason this is interesting is it's a marked as auto-elevating (so will silently run code as UAC admin if the caller is a split-token administrator) and it can be manually started by the non-administrator user.<br/>

<br/>
We can see the <i>Principal </i>property, which determines what account the task runs as and the <i>Actions</i>&nbsp;property which determines what to run. In the <i>Principal</i>&nbsp;property we can see the <i>Group to run as</i>&nbsp;is <i>Authenticated Users </i>which really means it will run as the logged on user starting the task. We also see the <i>RunLevel </i>is set to <i>Highest </i>which means the Task Scheduler will try and elevate the task to administrator without any prompting.<br/>
<br/>
It's using an environment variable as part of the path, and <b>in UAC scenarios these can be influenced by a normal user by writing to the registry key <i>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Enviroment</i>&nbsp;and specifying a <i>REG_SZ</i>&nbsp;value.</b><br/>

If you want to find other potential candidates the following Powershell script will find all tasks with<br/>
executable actions which will auto elevate. On my system there are 4 separate tasks, but only one (the SilentCleanup task) can be executed as a normal user, so the rest are not exploitable. Good thing I guess.<br/>
