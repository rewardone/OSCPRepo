<title>S4U Logon</title>
</head><body>The windows task scheduler allows a split token administrator to register a task which runs as a batch job from a limited privilege context. This doesn't require a user's password to accomplish as the task will be run non-interactively and so doesn't need access to the password in order to access remote resources. Due to the way that batch logons work in the latest versions of Windows for a split token admin user this actually creates the fully privileged token to execute the task under.<br/>
<br/>
This can be exploited by malicious code to bypass UAC prompts by registering one of these tasks then executing it. It will run arbitrary code with the user's full token leading to elevation of privilege. If you specify in the task a TaskLevel of HighestAvailable the registration will fail with an access denied error. <b>However even though the RunLevel is LeastPrivilege the S4U logon still results in a full token. </b><br/>
<br/>
Note: this seems to be an issue with UAC and how the task scheduler handles batch logon tasks. Therefore it might not be considered bulletin class. This is being disclosed due to how trivial it is to exploit if a user is running as a split token administrator. It might also be symptomatic of a deeper issue.<br/>
<br/>
Provided is a PoC which exploits the issue on Windows 8.1 update. There are two files, a powershell script and a template task XML file. To reproduce execute the following steps:<br/>
<br/>
1) Login as a split token admin with UAC enabled (doesn't matter to what prompt level, this works will full prompting). Start powershell under the low privileged token.<br/>
2) Enable script support in powershell by executing the command: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted. This has nothing to do with the exploit, it's only to allow the execution of the script. <br/>
3) Change task in task.xml to your command!<br/>
3) Execute elevate_task_scheduler.ps1<br/>
4) It should print "Successfully run as admin" which indicates the task was able to write hello.txt to the Windows folder.<br/>
