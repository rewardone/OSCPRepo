<title>COMObject</title>
</head><body><b>FileOperation COM Object</b><br/>
The IFileOperation COM object has a method that we can use to copy files to our secure location as the operation will auto-elevate and able to do a privilege copy. To exploit we can in inject our malicious DLL in a medium integrity process to carry out the operation. Since the COM object is set to auto-elevate the injected process does not need to be marked for auto-elevation in its manifest.<br/>
<br/>
On Windows 7 injected processes that have copied successfully are<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;C:\Windows\explorer.exe <br/>
&nbsp;C:\Windows\System32\wuauclt.exe<br/>
&nbsp;C:\Windows\System32\taskhost.exe<br/>
During tests taskhost.exe only happens to work once after boot and wuauclt.exe doesn’t always work which leaves explorer.exe is only the reliable process to use.<br/>
<br/>
On Windows 8 injected processes that have copied successfully are<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;C:\Windows\explorer.exe<br/>
&nbsp;C:\Windows\System32\wuauclt.exe<br/>
&nbsp;C:\Windows\System32\RuntimeBroker.exe<br/>
Again explorer.exe is only the reliable process to use I found during my tests and the only one that worked on Windows 8.1</body></html>
