<b>Mitigation for developers</b><br/>
For software developers there are a number of actions they can take<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;Use SetEnvironmentVariable(TEXT(“PATH”),NULL) API which removes the path environment variable from its search order</li>
<li>Change default installation folder to C:\Program Files</li>
<li>Use fully qualified path when loading DLLs, i.e. LoadLibrary(“C:\\program files\\MyApp\\mylibrary.dll”);</li>
<li>Use SetDllDirectory(“”) API removing the current working directory from the search order</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<b>Mitigation for IT professionals</b><br/>
For IT support professionals there are also a number of actions that can be taken<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;When packaging and deploying software via deployment tools such as Marimba, Landesk, etc. or manually  installing software change the installation folder to C:\Program Files</li>
<li>If software needs to be installed on the root check there are no binaries needing SYSTEM privileges</li>
<li>If SYSTEM privileges are required then change the ACL’s of the folder</li>
<li>Remove the path entry from the SYSTEM path variable if not needed</li>
</ul>
