War files need to be unzipped when they are deployed, and you need to know where to go. If using msfvenom, make sure to:<br/>
jar -xvf your_war.war <br/>
<br/>
and make note of the shell.jsp page (msfvenom makes it a random generated file name). Navigate there once your war is deployed and started.</body></html>
