</head><body><b>Reverse DNS-lookup</b><br/>
If you manage to figure out the IP range that the target owns. You can see which machines are online. And then you can run a script to find out the domain-addresses of those machines. That way you might find something new.<br/>
The text-file onlyIps.txt is a textfile with one IP-address on each line.<br/>
#!/bin/bash<br/>
while read p; do<br/>
&nbsp; echo $p;<br/>
&nbsp; host &nbsp;$p<br/>
done &lt;onlyIps.txt<br/>
<br/>
You can use standard UNIX / Linux utilities such as nslookup command, dig command or host command to find out reverse DNS of a given IP address.</body></html>
