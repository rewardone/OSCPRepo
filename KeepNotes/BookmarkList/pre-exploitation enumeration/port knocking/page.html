<title>Port knocking</title>
</head><body>Port-knocking the a obfuscation-as-security technique. It basically means that after knocking on ports in a specific sequence a certain port will open automatically. It seems to be more popular in Capture-the-flag contests than real life networks.<br/>
<br/>
Opening<br/>
So, how do we actually knock? As mentioned before a knock is essentially just sending a packet to a specific port.<br/>
<br/>
Knock<br/>
apt-get install knockd<br/>
Then you simply type: knock [ip] [port]. For example: knock 192.168.1.102 4000 5000 6000<br/>
<br/>
Nmap/bash<br/>
for x in 4000 5000 6000; do nmap -Pn --host_timeout 201 --max-retries 0 -p $x server_ip_address; done<br/>
<br/>
Netcat<br/>
nc 192.168.1.102 4000<br/>
nc 192.168.1.102 5000<br/>
nc 192.168.1.102 6000<br/>
nc 192.168.1.102 8888<br/>
<br/>
Sniff it<br/>
One way hack a server with port-knocking implemented would be to sniff for packets on the network. So if you are on the same network and able to make MITM, you can just sniff that traffic and then find the sequence.</body></html>
