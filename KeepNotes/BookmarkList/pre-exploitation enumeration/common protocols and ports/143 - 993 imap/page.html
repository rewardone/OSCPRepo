<title>143 / 993: IMAP</title>
</head><body>IMAP lets you access email stored on that server. So imagine that you are on a network at work, the emails you recieve is not stored on your computer but on a specific mail-server. So every time you look in your inbox your email-client (like outlook) fetches the emails from the mail-server using imap.+<br/>
<br/>
IMAP is a lot like pop3. But with IMAP you can access your email from various devices. With pop3 you can only access them from one device.<br/>
Port 993 is the secure port for IMAP.</body></html>
