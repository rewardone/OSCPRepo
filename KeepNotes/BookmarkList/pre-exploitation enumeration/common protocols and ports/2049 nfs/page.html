<title>2049: NFS</title>
</head><body>Network file system This is a service used so that people can access certain parts of a remote filesystem. If this is badly configured it could mean that you grant excessive access to users<br/>
<br/>
If the service is on its default port you can run this command to see what the filesystem is sharing<br/>
showmount -e 192.168.1.109<br/>
<br/>
Then you can mount the filesystem to your machine using the following command<br/>
mount 192.168.1.109:/ /tmp/NFS<br/>
mount -t 192.168.1.109:/ /tmp/NFS<br/>
<br/>
Now we can go to /tmp/NFS and check out /etc/passwd, and add and remove files.<br/>
<br/>
This can be used to escalate privileges if it is not correct configured.</body></html>
