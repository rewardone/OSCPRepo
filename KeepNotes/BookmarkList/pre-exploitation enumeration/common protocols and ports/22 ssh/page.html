<title>22: SSH</title>
</head><body>SSH is such an old and fundamental technology so most modern version are quite hardened. You can find out the version of the SSH either but scanning it with nmap or by connecting with it using nc.<br/>
<br/>
nc 192.168.1.10 22<br/>
It returnes something like this: SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.2p2 Ubuntu-4ubuntu1<br/>
This banner is defined in RFC4253, in chapter 4.2 Protocol Version Exchange. http://www.openssh.com/txt/rfc4253.txt The protocol-version string should be defined like this: SSH-protoversion-softwareversion SP comments CR LF Where comments is optional. And SP means space, and CR (carriege return) and LF (Line feed) So basically the comments should be separated by a space.</body></html>
