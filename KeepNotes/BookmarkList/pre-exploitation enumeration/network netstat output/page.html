Local address 0.0.0.0 means that the service is listening on all interfaces. This means that it can receive a connection from the network card, from the loopback interface or any other interface. This means that anyone can connect to it.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Local address 127.0.0.1</b><br/>
Local address 127.0.0.1 means that the service is only listening for connection from the your PC. Not from the internet or anywhere else. This is interesting to us!<br/>
<br/>
<b>Local address 192.168.x.x / 10.10.x.x</b><br/>
Local address 192.168.1.9 means that the service is only listening for connections from the local network. So someone in the local network can connect to it, but not someone from the internet. This is also interesting to us!</body></html>
