<br/>
<b>Comptuer Accounts</b><br/>
Every computer joined to AD has an associated computer account in AD. A Computer account in AD is a security principal (sam as user accounts and &nbsp;security groups) and as such has a number of attributes that are the same as those found on user accounts including a Security Identifier (SID), memberOf, lastlogondate, passwordlastset, etc. Computer accounts can belong to security groups and often do for a variety of reasons, most commonly for Group Poolicy filtering so that certain group policies only apply to specific groups of computers (or not). <br/>
<br/>
The computer account password is initially set when the computer joins the domain and is used for authentication in mcuh the same way as a user's password is. The difference is that a computer's password doesn't have to be changed on a regular basis in order for the computer to authenticate to the domain (unliek user accounts). There is a setting that configures how often the computer account password "should" be changed and computers in the domain will typically change their computer account password about every 30 days (by default). With that said, <a href="https://adsecurity.org/?p=280">this threshold can be changed,</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://adsecurity.org/?p=2011">process used to change the computer account passworwd can be disabled entirely</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Computer account password changes are more of a guideline than a rule, and I have posted previously about how a computer account password could be u<a href="https://adsecurity.org/?p=2011]">sed to wield significant power over that system</a>. However, I didn't cover the other angels which are explored in this article. <br/>
<br/>
Computer accounts are members of the "Domain Computers" AD group by default, and are often added to Active Directory groups for purposes of group policy management, though there are other reasons for adding computer accounts to AD groups. <br/>
<br/>
Common examples of Computers in groups:<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Domain Controllers are members of the "Domain Controllers" group<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Read-Only Domain Controllers (RODC)s are members of the "Read-Only Domain Controllers" group<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Exchange servers are often members of different Exchange AD groups such as "Exchange Servers"<br/>
<br/>
<b>Computers as Admins?</b><br/>
The obvious question is 'what is the impact of a computer in an admin group?'<br/>
<br/>
When a computer authenticates to the domain, typically via Kerberos, there is a ticket/token created that contains the computer's SID and all SIDs for security groups the computer is a member of, just like when a user logs on. This means that the authenticated computer has these rights to resources in the domain/forest similar to a user who is a member of the same group. If a computer account is in an admin group, the computer account has admin rights and by extension, and admin on that computer could gain those same rights. <br/>
<br/>
Computer accounts can have elevated rights to resource, including full admin rights to Active Directory<br/>
<br/>
<b>How does the computer leverage these rights or access?</b>&nbsp;<br/>
The computer's System account "owns" the ticket/token containing the SIDs that have these rights (technically "System" isn't an account, but it works for this description). Anyone who has (local) administrative rights on a computer can <a href="https://adsecurity.org/?page_id=1821#TOKENElevate">change the context of their rights</a>&nbsp;to System to effectively take ownership of the computer account's rights in AD. <a href="https://adsecurity.org/?page_id=1821">Mimikatz</a>&nbsp;provides the ability to grab all Kerberos tickets and tokens on the system, so it is trivial to reuse these in order to leverage these rights. <br/>
<br/>
Note that there is no functional difference between a computer account having the rights or a service account with the rights that has it's credentials stored on the system running as a service. Both of these lead to credential exposure if the system is compromised. However, service accounts are managed quite differently than computer accounts and using a service account is &nbsp;better in most cases.<br/>
