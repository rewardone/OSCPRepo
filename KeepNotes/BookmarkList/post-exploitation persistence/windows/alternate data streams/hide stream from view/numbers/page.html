</head><body>Side note 2: You can also create an ADS on a folder with a name such as “abc”. Then you can rename the folder to a name just containing numbers (e.g. “1”). After that you can still see the ADS, but you can’t open it (ADS on a folder with a number as name doesn’t work). To open the ADS data you have to rename the folder first back to for example “abc”.<br/>
<br/>
Script/attacker would just need to rename to string every time they want to execute. <br/>
