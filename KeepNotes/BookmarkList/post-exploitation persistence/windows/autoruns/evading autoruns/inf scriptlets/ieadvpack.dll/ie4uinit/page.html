This blog post indicates that IE4Uinit is used in conjunction with Active Setup and runs when a user profile is created for the first time (or ‘fictitiously’ every time when mandatory profiles are configured) during the logon process. &nbsp;Additionally, several command switches were revealed that demonstrated usage<br/>

IE4uinit calls ieuinit.inf<br/>
<br/>
Instances of ieuinit.inf reside in the \System32 and \SysWOW64 directories. &nbsp;<br/>
This is &nbsp;interesting because such files cannot be edited without proper privileges (and some command line Kung Fu). &nbsp;However, this minor roadblock can be overcome based on a few interesting observations:<br/>
<br/>
A full/static path to ieuinit.inf does not exist (at least in the context of our Strings analysis). &nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;This means that we can call (‘side load’) an instance of ieuinit.inf as long as it is in the same directory as an instance of ie4uinit.exe.<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;Even as an unprivileged user, we can simply copy these files out of the \System32 directory, make desired INF file edits in a user writable directory, and test for SCT payload execution.<br/>
<br/>
Let’s copy these files into a working directory and update the INF file accordingly:<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;copy "C:\Windows\System32\ie4uinit.exe" "C:\test\"<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;copy "C:\Windows\System32\ieuinit.inf" "C:\test\"<br/>
<br/>
In this use case, the lead-in INF directive calls a section labeled DefaultInstall.Windows7, which initiates MSIE4RegisterOCX.Windows7. &nbsp;This is where we add our scrobj.dll/SCT URL payload<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
"Properly" execute the payload with:<br/>
ie4uinit.exe -BaseSettings<br/>
<br/>
**Note: During the course of testing across platforms, I’ve noticed an interesting problem on one of my machines where I could not invoke the script within the MSIE4RegisterOCX.Windows7 section. &nbsp;After adding a new section (FunRun) with our scrobj.dll/SCT entry, I modified the DefaultInstall.Windows7 section with the addition of UnregisterOCXs to point to the FunRun section. &nbsp;The end-to-end invocation was successful. &nbsp;This may prove helpful if anyone has problems when trying to test this method. Root cause of this problem has not been determined</body></html>
