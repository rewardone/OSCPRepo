<title>Usage</title>
</head><body>Syntax<br/>
Set the rinetd.conf file in the same directory (Windows) or /etc/rinetd.conf (Linux)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;bind address&gt; &lt;bind port&gt; &lt;connect address&gt; &lt;connect port&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Breakdown<br/>
bind address/port: The “incoming” IP addr, that which we wish to bind on and forwarding packets originally targeted to it onwards.<br/>
connect address/port: The “outgoing” IP addr, that which we wish to send the packets onwards to.<br/>
<br/>
Example<br/>
A server we have compromised is originally located on 10.1.1.223:80 and we wish to forward all the HTTP requests onto our malicious server at 10.1.1.250:8080.<br/>
<br/>
rinetd.conf<br/>
<br/>
#bindaddress #bindport #connectaddress #connectport<br/>
10.1.1.223 80 10.1.1.250 8080<br/>
<br/>
Run Rinetd, all traffic being sent to the server on 10.1.1.223 will be routed to 10.1.1.250 port 8080. <br/>
Likewise any responses from 10.1.1.250:8080 will be routed back through 10.1.1.223 to the original requester.</body></html>
