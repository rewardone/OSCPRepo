<title>VPN Over SSH</title>
</head><body>VPN over SSH<br/>
Since openssh release 4.3 it is possible to tunnel layer 3 network traffic via an established ssh channel. This has an advantage over a typical tcp tunnel because you are in control of ip traffic. So, for example, you are able to perform SYN-scan with nmap and use your tools directly <b>without resorting to proxychains or other proxifying tools</b>. It’s done via the creation of tun devices on client and server side and transferring the data between them over ssh connection. This is quite simple, <b>but you need root on both machines</b>&nbsp;since the creation of tun devices is a privileged operation. These lines should be present in your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file (server-side):<br/>
<br/>
PermitRootLogin yes<br/>
PermitTunnel yes<br/>
<br/>
The following command on the client will create a pair of tun devices on client and server:<br/>
ssh username@server -w any:any<br/>
<br/>
The flag -w accepts the number of tun device on each side separated with a colon. It can be set explicitly - -w 0:0 or you can use -w any:any syntax to take the next available tun device.<br/>
<br/>
The tunnel between the tun devices is enabled but the interfaces are yet to be configured. Example of configuring client-side:<br/>
ip addr add 1.1.1.2/32 peer 1.1.1.1 dev tun0<br/>
<br/>
Server-side:<br/>
ip addr add 1.1.1.1/32 peer 1.1.1.2 dev tun0<br/>
<br/>
Enable ip forwarding and NAT on the server:<br/>
echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward<br/>
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 1.1.1.2 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE<br/>
<br/>
Now you can make the peer host 1.1.1.1 your default gateway or route a specific host/network through it:<br/>
route add -net 10.0.0.0/16 gw 1.1.1.1<br/>
<br/>
In this example the server’s external network interface is eth0 and the newly created tun devices on both sides are tun0.<br/>
