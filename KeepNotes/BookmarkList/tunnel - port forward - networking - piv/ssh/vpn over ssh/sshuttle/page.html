<br/>
Transparent proxy server that works as a poor man's VPN. Forwards over ssh. Doesn't require admin. Works with Linux and MacOS. Supports DNS tunneling.<br/>
<br/>
What's sshuttle? It's a Python app that makes use of SSH to create a on-the-fly VPN between your Linux, BSD, or Mac OS X machine and a remote system that has SSH access and Python. Written by Avery Pennarun and licensed under the GPLv2, sshuttle is a transparent proxy server that lets users fake a VPN with minimal hassle.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Configuration<br/>
You don’t need to configure anything either on local or remote side. Just install python on your remote system if it doesn’t has.<br/>
<br/>
Usage<br/>
Connecting to remote systems using sshuttle is fairly simple and straight forward.<br/>
<br/>
From your local system Terminal, enter command:<br/>
<br/>
# sshuttle -r username@sshserver 0.0.0.0/0 -vv<br/>
Or<br/>
$ sudo sshuttle -r username@sshserver 0.0.0.0/0 -vv<br/>
Or<br/>
$ sudo sshuttle -r username@sshserver 0/0 -vv<br/>
<br/>
If you would also like your DNS queries to be proxied through the DNS server of the server you are connect to, then connect as shown below.<br/>
<br/>
# sshuttle --dns -vvr username@sshserver 0/0<br/>
Or<br/>
$ sudo sshuttle --dns -vvr username@sshserver 0/0<br/>
<br/>
You will be may be prompted for one or more passwords; first, the local password to become root using either sudo or su, and then the remote ssh password.<br/>
<br/>
That’s it. Now you’ll be able to access your remote clients.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Other examples<br/>
<b>1. Tunnel all traffic</b><br/>
This is the first command I learned. It forwards all TCP traffic and DNS requests to a remote SSH server.<br/>
<br/>
sshuttle --dns -vr ssh_server 0/0<br/>
<br/>
Just like ssh, you can use any server specified in ~/.ssh/config. The -v flag means verbose mode.<br/>
Besides TCP and DNS, currently sshuttle does not forward other requests such as UDP, ICMP ping etc.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2. Tunnel all traffic, but exclude some</b><br/>
You can exclude certain TCP traffic using -x option.<br/>
<br/>
sshuttle --dns -vr ssh_server -x 121.9.204.0/24 -x 61.135.196.21 0/0<br/>
<br/>
For instance, when I am in China, I don’t want to tunnel Youku.com traffic to a foreign server, because its movie streaming service is only available within China.<br/>
In this case, I use -x option to exclude Youku.com IP addresses.<br/>
<br/>
<b>3. Tunnel only certain traffic</b><br/>
To tunnel only certain TCP traffic, specify the IP addresses or IP ranges that need tunneling.<br/>
<br/>
sshuttle -vr ssh_server 121.9.204.0/24 61.135.196.21<br/>
<br/>
This command comes in handy, whenever I need to test an app feature (e.g. Netflix movie streaming) which only available in certain countries, or to bypass ISP faulty caches.<br/>
<br/>
<b>4. VPN to office network</b><br/>
I seldom do VPN, but all you need is the remote SSH server with -NH flags turned on.<br/>
<br/>
sshuttle -NHvr office_ssh_server<br/>
<br/>
-N flag tells sshuttle to figure out by itself the IP subnets to forward, and -H flag to scan for hostnames within remote subnets and store them temporarily in /etc/hosts.<br/>
