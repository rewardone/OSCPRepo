<br/>
DESCRIPTION<br/>
<br/>
Redirects TCP connections from one IP address and port to another. rinetd is a single-process server which handles any number of connections to the address/port pairs specified in the file /etc/rinetd.conf. Since rinetd runs as a single process using nonblocking I/O, it is able to redirect a large number of connections without a severe impact on the machine. This makes it practical to run TCP services on machines inside an IP masquerading firewall. rinetd does not redirect FTP, because FTP requires more than one socket.<br/>
<br/>
rinetd is typically launched at boot time, using the following syntax:<br/>
<br/>
/usr/sbin/rinetd<br/>
<br/>
The configuration file is found in the file /etc/rinetd.conf, unless another file is specified using the -c command line option.<br/>
