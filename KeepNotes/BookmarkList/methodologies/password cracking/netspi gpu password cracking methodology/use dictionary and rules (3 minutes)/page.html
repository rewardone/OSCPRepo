<title>Use Dictionary and rules (3 minutes*)</title>
</head><body>1. Use the dictionary and rules (Three minutes*)<br/>
<br/>
Our dictionary file will typically catch the simple passwords. Our dictionary includes previously cracked passwords and most dictionary-word-based passwords will be in here. Add in a couple of simple rules (d3ad0ne, passwordspro, etc.) and this will catch a few of the “smarter” users with passwords like “1qaz2wsx%“. As for the starting rules, we’re currently using a mix of the default oclHashcat rules and some of the rules from KoreLogic’s 2010 rule list – http://contest-2010.korelogic.com/rules-hashcat.html For our sample set of data, the dictionary attack (with a couple of rules) caught 372 of the remaining 698 hashes (53%).</body></html>
