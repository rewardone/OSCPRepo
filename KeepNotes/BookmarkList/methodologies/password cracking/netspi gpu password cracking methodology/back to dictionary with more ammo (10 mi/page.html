<title>Back to Dictionary with more ammo (10 minutes*)</title>
</head><body>After we’ve cracked some of the passwords, we will want to funnel those results back into our mangling attacks. It’s not hard for us to guess “!123Acme123!” after we’ve already cracked “Acme123“. Just use the cracked passwords as your dictionary and repeat your rule-based attacks. This is also a good point to combine rules. oclHashcat allows you to combine rule sets to do a multi-vector mangle on your dictionary words. I’ve had pretty good luck with combining the best64 and the d3ad0neV3 rules, but your mileage may vary.<br/>

Using this technique, we were able to crack four of the remaining 297 (1.3%) uncracked hashes.</body></html>
