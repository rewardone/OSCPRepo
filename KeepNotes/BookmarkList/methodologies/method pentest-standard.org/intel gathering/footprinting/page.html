<title>Footprinting</title>
</head><body>= Footprinting =<br/>
WHAT IT IS: External information gathering, also known as footprinting, is a phase of information gathering that consists of &nbsp;interaction with the target in order to gain information from a perspective external to the organization.<br/>
<br/>
WHY: Much information can be gathered by interacting with targets. By probing a service or device, you can often create scenarios in which it can be fingerprinted, or even more simply, a banner can be procured which will identify the device. This step is necessary to gather more information about your targets. Your goal, after this section, is a prioritized list of targets.</body></html>
