<title>DNS Bruteforce</title>
</head><body>==== DNS Bruteforce ====<br/>
After identifying all the information that is associated with the client domain(s), it is now time to begin to query DNS. Since DNS is used to map IP addresses to hostnames, and vice versa we will want to see if it is insecurely configure. We will seek to use DNS to reveal additional information about the client. One of the most serious misconfigurations involving DNS is allowing Internet users to perform a DNS zone transfer. There are several tools that we can use to enumerate DNS to not only check for the ability to perform zone transfers, but to potentially discover additional host names that are not commonly known.</body></html>
