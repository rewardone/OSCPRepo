<title>Identifying patch levels</title>
</head><body>==== Identifying patch levels ====<br/>

Credentials may be used for this phase of the penetration test, provided the client has acquiesced. Vulnerability scanners are particularly effective at identifying patch levels remotely, without credentials.<br/>
