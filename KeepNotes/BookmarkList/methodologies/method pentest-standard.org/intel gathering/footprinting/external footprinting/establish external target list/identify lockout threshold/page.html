<title>Identify lockout threshold</title>
</head><body>==== Identify lockout threshold ====<br/>
Identifying the lockout threshold of an authentication service will allow you to ensure that your bruteforce attacks do not intentionally lock out valid users during your testing. Identify all disparate authentication services in the environment, and test a single, innocuous account for lockout. Often 5 - 10 tries of a valid account is enough to determine if the service will lock users out.</body></html>
