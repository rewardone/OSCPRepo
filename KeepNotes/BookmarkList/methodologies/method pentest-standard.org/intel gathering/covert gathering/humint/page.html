<title>HUMINT</title>
</head><body>== HUMINT ==<br/>
Human intelligence complements the more passive gathering on the asset as it provides information that could not have been obtained otherwise, as well as add more “personal” perspectives to the intelligence picture (feelings, history, relationships between key individuals, “atmosphere”, etc...)<br/>
<br/>
The methodology of obtaining human intelligence always involves direct interaction - whether physical, or verbal. Gathering should be done under an assumed identity, that would be created specifically to achieve optimal information exposure and cooperation from the asset in question.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, intelligence gathering on more sensitive targets can be performed by utilizing observation only - again, either physically on location, or through electronic/remote means (CCTV, webcams, etc...). This is usually done in order to establish behavioral patterns (such as frequency of visitations, dress code, access paths, key locations that may provide additional access such as coffee shops).</body></html>
