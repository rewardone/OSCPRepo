Due to the nature of a penetration test, you must ensure that you cover all your bases when dealing with the client and the tasks you will be performing. Discuss the following with the client to ensure a clear understanding of the roles and responsibilities of both client and provider prior to beginning any work.<br/>
*Ensure that the contract and/or statement of work signed by both the client and provider that the actions taken on the systems being tested are on behalf and in representation of the client.<br/>
*Obtain a copy of the security policies that govern user use of company systems and infrastructure (often referred to as "Acceptable Use" policies) prior to starting the engagement. Verify that policy covers:<br/>
**Personal use of equipment and storage of personal employee data on the client systems and ownership and rights on that data.<br/>
**Ownership of data stored on company equipment.<br/>
*Confirm regulations and laws that govern the data that is managed and used by the client on their systems and the restrictions imposed on such data.<br/>
*Use full drive encryption for those systems and removable media that will receive and store client data.<br/>
*Discuss and establish with the client the procedures to follow in the case that a compromise from a third party is found.<br/>
*Check for laws concerning the capture and/or storage of audio and video since the use of this methods in post-exploitation may be considered a violation of local or country wiretap laws.</body></html>
