<title>Thru Compromised System</title>
</head><body>=== Thru Compromised System ===<br/>
Actions that can be taken thru a compromised system:<br/>
*Port Forwarding<br/>
*Proxy to internal network (SSH)<br/>
*VPN to internal network<br/>
*Execute Remote Exploit<br/>
*Abuse of compromised credentials and keys (Webpages, Databases..etc)<br/>
The action that will be executed will depend on the information needed to show specific risk and/or further penetrating the client's network and hosts. Regular planning sessions are recommended to re-evaluate the information gather and decide the best approach to continue the post exploitation until the set goals are meet.</body></html>
