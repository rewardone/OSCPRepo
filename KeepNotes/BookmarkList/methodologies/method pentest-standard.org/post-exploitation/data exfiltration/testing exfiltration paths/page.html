<title>Testing exfiltration paths</title>
</head><body>=== Testing exfiltration paths ===<br/>
Per exfiltration paths mapping, data should be exfiltrated from the organization being tested. This should already be covered in the [[Pre-engagement]] scoping and adequate infrastructure should have been setup which adheres to the customer's acceptable engagement policy (i.e. data being exfiltrated is usually exfiltrated to a server in the full control of the tester, and will access and ownership right to the tested organization). <br/>
The exfiltration itself should simulate real-world exfiltration strategies used by the threat actors that correspond to the [[Threat Modeling Standard]] relevant for the organization (i.e. if criminal mostly then "standard" exfiltration using a staging area inside the network where data is archived inside zip/7z encrypted files and then sent to FTP/HTTP servers on the Internet, if a more sophisticated threat actor then using means that simulate such strategies and tactics used for exfiltration).</body></html>
