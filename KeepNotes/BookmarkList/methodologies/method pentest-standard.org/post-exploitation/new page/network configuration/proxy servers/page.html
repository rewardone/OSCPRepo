<title>Proxy Servers</title>
</head><body>==== Proxy Servers ====<br/>
Identify network and application level proxy servers. Proxy servers make good targets when in enterprise-wide use by the client. In the case of application proxies, it may be possible to identify, modify and/or monitor the flow of traffic, or the traffic itself. Proxy attacks are often an effective means to show impact and risk to the customer.</body></html>
