<title>Cached DNS Entries</title>
</head><body>==== Cached DNS Entries ====<br/>
Identify high value DNS entries in the cache, which may include login pages for Intranet sites, management interfaces, or external sites. Cached interfaces provide information of the most recent and most used host used by the compromised host providing a view of the relations and interactions of the hosts providing information that could be used to prioritization of targets for further penetration of the target network and infrastructure. Modification of cached entries if permitted can be used to capture authentication credential, authentication tokens or to gain further information on services used by the compromised hosts leading to further penetration of the target network.</body></html>
