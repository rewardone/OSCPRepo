</head><body>==== Startup Items ====<br/>
Most systems will have applications that can run at system startup or at user logon that can provide information about the purpose of the system, software and services it interacts with. This information may reveal potential countermeasures that could be in place that may hinder further exploitation of a target network and it’s systems (e.g. HIDS/HIPS, Application Whitelisting, FIM). Information that should be gathered includes:<br/>
*List of the applications and their associated versions installed on the system.<br/>
*List of operating system updates applied to the system.</body></html>
