<title>Network traffic capture</title>
</head><body>==== Network traffic capture ====<br/>
Network traffic capture can be used depending on the controls on the network and medium used for capture can be used to:<br/>
*Identify hosts on the network<br/>
*Intercept data<br/>
*Identify services<br/>
*Identify relations between hosts in the network<br/>
*Capture of credentials<br/>
Care should be taken to only capture traffic covered under the scope of the engagement and that the information captured does not fall under the control of local laws like the capture of Voice Over IP calls. Information retained and shown should be filtered so as to protect client’s customer and/or employee personal and confidential data.</body></html>
