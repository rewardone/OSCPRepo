<title>Purpose</title>
</head><body>== Purpose ==<br/>
<br/>
The exploitation phase of a penetration test focuses solely on establishing access to a system or resource by bypassing security restrictions. If the prior phase, vulnerability analysis was performed properly, this phase should be well planned and a precision strike.. &nbsp;The main focus is to identify the main entry point into the organization and to identify high value target assets.<br/>
<br/>
If the vulnerability analysis phase was properly completed, a high value target list should have been complied. Ultimately the attack vector should take into consideration the success probability and highest impact on the organization.</body></html>
