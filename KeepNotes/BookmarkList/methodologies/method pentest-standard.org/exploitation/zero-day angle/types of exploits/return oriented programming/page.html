</head><body>==== Return Oriented Programming ====<br/>
<br/>
Return Oriented Programming (ROP) is a technique used during a portion where the user has control of execution flow however data execution prevention (DEP) or other precluding defense mechanisms may be in place. In the situation where DEP is enabled, the attacker does not have direct access to execute specific assembly instructions, therefor the attacker buildsa ROP gadget in order to prep certain Windows API calls or techniques to disable DEP or circumvent DEP. A common method is leveraging the WriteProcessMemory call to copy data from the stack into a writable memory space that can then be executed. </body></html>
