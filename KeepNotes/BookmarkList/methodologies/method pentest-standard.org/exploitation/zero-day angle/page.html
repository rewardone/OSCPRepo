<title>Zero-Day Angle</title>
</head><body>== Zero-Day Angle == <br/>
<br/>
In most cases, the zero-day angle is often a last resort for most penetration testers. This type of attack often represents a highly advanced organization that can handle a focused attack against the organization through normal attack methods. In certain scenarios research may be conducted in order to reverse engineer, fuzz, or perform advanced discovery of vulnerabilities that have not been discovered. In the event this type of attack is applicable, ensure that the environment to the best of the attackers knowledge is reproduced to include countermeasure technology.<br/>
<br/>
In order for zero-day exploits to be successful (or any exploit for that matter), having the same operating system, patches, and countermeasures is highly important on success. Sometimes this information may not be available based on the level of access or enumeration that has occurred.</body></html>
