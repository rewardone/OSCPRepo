</head><body>=== Address Space Layout Randomization ===<br/>
<br/>
During a buffer overflow vulnerability (or that of anything where we control memory), memory addresses are hardcoded in order redirect execution flow to our shellcode. In the event of ASLR, certain bytes are randomized in order to prevent an attacker from predicting where he/she can always go to in order to execute shellcode.</body></html>
