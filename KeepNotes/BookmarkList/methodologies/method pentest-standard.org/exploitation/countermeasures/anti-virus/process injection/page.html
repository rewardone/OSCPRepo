<title>Process Injection</title>
</head><body>==== Process Injection ====<br/>
<br/>
Process injection is simply the method to inject into an already running process. By injecting into a process, the information of the application can be hidden within a process that would normally be trusted in nature. It's very difficult for preventative measure technology to inspect running processes and can almost always hide in a different process that the application would think is a trusted one.</body></html>
