Stress testing or Denial of Service testing should be discussed before the engagement begins. It can be a topic that many organizations are uncomfortable with due to the potentially damaging nature of the testing. If an organization is only worried about the confidentiality or integrity of their data, stress testing may not be necessary; however, if the organization is also worried about the availability of their services, then the stress testing should be conducted in a non-production environment which is identical to the production environment.</body></html>
