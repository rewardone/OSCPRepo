Before performing a penetration test it is beneficial to determine the maturity level of the client’s security posture. There are a number of organizations which choose to jump directly into a penetration test first assessing this maturity level. For customers with a very immature security program, it is often a good idea to perform a vulnerability analysis first.<br/>
<br/>
Some testers believe there is a stigma surrounding Vulnerability Analysis (VA) work. Those testers have forgotten that the goal is to identify risks in the target organization, not about pursuing the so-called “rockstar” lifestyle. If a company is not ready for a full penetration test, they will get far more value out of a good VA than a penetration test.<br/>
<br/>
Establish with the customer in advance what information about the systems they will be providing. It may also be helpful to ask for information about vulnerabilities which are already documented. This will save the testers time and save the client money by not overlapping testing discoveries with known issues. Likewise, a full or partial white-box test may bring the customer more value than a black-box test, if it isn't absolutely required by compliance.</body></html>
