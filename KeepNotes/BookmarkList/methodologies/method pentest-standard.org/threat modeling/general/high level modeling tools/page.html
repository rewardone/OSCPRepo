</head><body>=== High level modeling tools ===<br/>
There are a variety of tools available to identify targets and map attack vectors. &nbsp;These normally focus on the business assets (what systems to target) and business processes (how to attack them.) &nbsp;Depending on the engagement, the penetration testing team may perform these exercises with no input from the customer; or they may spend a lot of time with customer stakeholders identifying targets of interest. &nbsp;Tools with a business asset focus usually require a quantitative input to describe how important each potential target is to test. &nbsp;The inputs may also be qualitative, such as a description by the customer’s CIO that a system is mission-critical.<br/>
Tools focused on business processes, information flows and technical architecture are used to identify potential attack vectors and choose which are mostly likely to succed or most likely to be used by a certain class of adversary.</body></html>
