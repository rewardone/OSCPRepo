<title>Communication mechanisms</title>
</head><body>=== Communication mechanisms ===<br/>
An analysis of communication mechanisms available to the threat agent/community should be made to evaluate the complexity of attacks against an organization. These communication mechanisms range from simple and openly available technologies such as encryption, through to specialist tools and services such as bulletproof hosting, use of drop-sites, and the use of known or unknown botnets to perform attacks or mask source information.<br/>
For example, as part of testing we test to see what the overall attack surface for an organization is from the outside. &nbsp;However, there is another whole component that is often times missed. &nbsp;What types of threats can exist post exploitation? &nbsp;This falls under the context of detecting exfiltration channels. &nbsp;Coincidentally, penetration testers are uniquely situated to test an organizations capability to detect command and control channels of today's modern malware.<br/>
When this is in scope, we recommend the tester create a series of malware specimens that increase the level of obfuscation used to hide C2. &nbsp; The goal is to create malware that is easily detected, then increase the obfuscation to the point where detection no longer occurs.</body></html>
