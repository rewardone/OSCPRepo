<title>Business Process Analysis</title>
</head><body>== Business Process Analysis ==<br/>
A business isn't a business if it doesn't make money. The way this happens is by having either raw goods or knowledge run through various processes to enhance them and create added value. This generates revenue. Business processes and the assets (people, technology, money) supporting them form value chains. By mapping these processes, identifying the critical vs. non-critical processes and eventually finding flaws in them we are able to understand how the business works, what makes them money and eventually how specific threat communities can make them lose money.<br/>
<br/>
In the business process analysis we differentiate between critical business processes, and non-critical processes. For each category the analysis is the same, and takes into account the same elements. The main difference is in the weighting that the threat from a critical business process is assigned with as opposed to a non-critical one.<br/>
Nevertheless, it's imperative to remember that an aggregation of a few non-critical business processes can be combined into a scenario that essentially forms a critical flaw within an element/process. Such threat scenarios should also be identified within this phase and mapped out for later use in the penetration test.</body></html>
