<title>Employee Data</title>
</head><body>==== Employee Data ====<br/>
Here employee data is being analyzed as any data that can have a DIRECT affect on the organization is obtained or compromised by an attacker. Organizations that have to adhere to some compliance which places fines on the loss or exposure of such data are obvious candidates for such a direct loss effect. Also, organizations who’s employees may be considered critical assets may also be subjected to such scrutiny (specific government bodies, specialized trade secret related employees/departments, etc…).<br/>
The following list provides examples to information realms of personal data that may be considered business assets for the threat modeling.<br/>
* National Identification Numbers (SSNs, etc.)<br/>
* Personally Identifiable Information (PII)<br/>
* Protected Health Information (PHI)<br/>
* Financial Information (e.g. bank, credit accounts)</body></html>
