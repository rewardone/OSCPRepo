<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>Enterprise domains can have a complex series of nested AD groups. These groups all have their own Access Control Entries, and subgroups inherit their parents ACEs by default. There are certain groups that have higher privileges than other by default. Through nesting and inheritance, there could exist a sequence of users or groups that could have privileges that would allow for privilege escalation by adding a user to a higher privileged group. <br/>
<br/>
One example chain is as follows:<br/>
During a recent penetration test, we managed to obtain a user account that was a member of the Organization Management security group. This group is created when Exchange is installed and provided access to Exchange-related activities. Besides access to these Exchange settings, it also allows its members to modify the group membership of other Exchange security groups, such as the Exchange Trusted Subsystem security group. This group is a member of the Exchange Windows Permissions security group.<br/>
<br/>
By default, the Exchange Windows Permissions security group has writeDACL permission on the domain object of the domain where Exchange was installed.<br/>
<br/>
The writeDACL permissions allows an identity to modify permissions on the designated object (in other words: modify the ACL) which means that by being a member of the Organization Management group we were able to escalate out privileges to that of a domain administrator.<br/>
<br/>
To exploit this, we added our user account that we obtained earlier to the Exchange Trusted Subsystem group. We logged on again (because security group memberships are only loaded during login) and now we were a member of the Exchange Trusted Subsystem group and the Exchange Windows Permission group, which allowed us to modify the ACL of the domain.</body></html>
