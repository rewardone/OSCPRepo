BloodHound <br/>
BloodHound is a single page Javascript web application, built on top of <a href="http://linkurio.us/">Linkurious</a>, compiled with <a href="http://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a>, with a <a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</a>&nbsp;database fed by a <a href="https://github.com/adaptivethreat/Bloodhound/wiki/PowerShell-Ingestor">PowerShell ingestor</a>.<br/>

BloodHound uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory environment. Attacks can use BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly identify. Defenders can use BloodHound to identify and eliminate those same attack paths. Both blue and red teams can use BloodHound to easily gain a deeper understanding of privilege relationships in an Active Directory environment.<br/>

BloodHound is a tool to analyze and understand Active Directory Trust Relationships. For an offensive practitioner, this tool can highlight the hops you might take to reach a goal within a network. For a defensive practitioner, this tool is gold as it can show you the most likely paths an attacker might take. It’s a good exercise to decide which of these trust paths needs to exist and which you can eliminate.<br/>
