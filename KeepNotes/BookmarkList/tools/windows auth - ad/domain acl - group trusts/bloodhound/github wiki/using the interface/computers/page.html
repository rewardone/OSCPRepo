<b>Node Info</b><br/>
<b>-Name</b>: This is the name of the node, and is in fully qualified format.<br/>
<br/>
<b>-OS</b>: The OS for the computer. This information is not currently gathered by the ingestor.<br/>
<br/>
<b>-Allows Unconstrained Delegation</b>: Whether the computer allows unconstrained delegation. This information is not currently gathered by the ingestor.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<b>Local Admins</b><br/>

<br/>
<b>-Unrolled Admins</b>: These are all of the effective groups and users that have administrator rights on the system. This is the equivalent of running Get-NetLocalGroup -ComputerName computername -Recurse<br/>
<br/>
