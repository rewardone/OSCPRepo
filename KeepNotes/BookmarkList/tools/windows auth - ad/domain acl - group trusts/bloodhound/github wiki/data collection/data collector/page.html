BloodHound now includes a completely custom C# ingestor written from the ground up to support collection activities. Two options exist for using the ingestor, an executable and a PowerShell script. Both ingestors support the same set of options. The command to run the PowerShell version is Invoke-BloodHound. Like all PowerShell scripts, it must be run in a PowerShell runspace without execution policy restrictions. For more information on running PowerShell with execution policy bypassed, see <a href="https://blog.netspi.com/15-ways-to-bypass-the-powershell-execution-policy/">this blog post by NetSPI</a>.<br/>

<br/>
<b>Invoke-BloodHound<br/>
</b>Invoke-BloodHound executes collection options necessary to populate the backend BloodHound database. With no options specified, by default it will gather all unrolled group membership information, all reachable domain trust information, and will gather all session/local admin data on all computers it can reach from your current domain. All data will be exported to CSV files in the current directory. The *-CSVFolder C:\Temp* parameter will modify the folder that the files are output to, and <b>-CSVPrefix domainX</b>&nbsp;will prepend the specified flag to the beginning of each output file.<br/>
<br/>
To export directly to the Neo4j REST API, use the -URI and -UserPass arguments.<br/>
<br/>
Cypher queries are built for each appropriate relationship to ingest, and the set of queries is 'batched' so multiple queries are sent at a time in each batch request. All of the Cypher queries are jsonified using System.Web.Script.Serialization.JavascriptSerializer.<br/>
<br/>
For user session data without a logon domain, by default the global catalog is used to attempt to deconflict what domain the user may be located in. If the user exists in more than one domain in the forest, a series of weights is used to modify the attack path likelihood. If you want to skip this global catalog deconfliction approach, specify the <b>-SkipGCDeconfliction</b>&nbsp;flag.<br/>
