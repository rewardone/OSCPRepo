<title>Intro</title>
</head><body>BloodHound requires three sets of information from an Active Directory environment in order to function:<br/>
<ul><li>Who is logged on where?</li>
<li>Who has admin rights where?</li>
<li>What users and groups belong to what groups?</li>
<li>(Optionally) What principals have control over other user and group objects?</li>
</ul>
<br/>
In most instances, collecting this information <b>does not require Administrator privileges</b>, and <b>does not require executing code on remote systems</b>. The PowerShell ingestor, based on PowerView, makes data collection fast and simple. The ingestor is located in the BloodHound repo at /PowerShell/BloodHound.ps1.<br/>
<br/>
<b>PowerShell execution policy</b><br/>
PowerShell by default will not allow execution of PowerShell scripts; however, bypassing this restriction is very simple in most instances. Typically you will be able to enter a PowerShell runspace without this restriction by running:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;PS C:\&gt; PowerShell -Exec Bypass<br/>

<b>Data Ingestion</b><br/>
We currently have two methods of ingesting data into BloodHound:<br/>
