You guessed it, simply run the following. (Bloodhound depends on neo4j so that will be installed as well.)<br/>
<br/>
apt-get install bloodhound<br/>
<br/>
launch Neo4j:<br/>
neo4j console<br/>
<br/>
We now have a remote interface available at http://localhost:7474. Let’s head over there via a browser and change that default password. You will also see that it enabled Bolt on the localhost, we need this for later<br/>
<br/>
Go ahead and complete the password change and close the browser window.<br/>
<br/>
Pop a new terminal window open and run the following command to launch Bloodhound, leave the Neo4j console running for obvious reasons.<br/>
bloodhound<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, Bloodhound is now running and waiting for some user input. Earlier when launching Neo4j it also enabled Bolt on bolt://127.0.0.1:7687. You need to use this as your Database URL.<br/>
<br/>
Database URL – bolt://127.0.0.1:7687<br/>
Username – neo4j<br/>
Password – your newly changed password<br/>
<br/>
Hit login and you should be presented with the Bloodhound tool minus any data. You can now import your data and get analyzing.</body></html>
