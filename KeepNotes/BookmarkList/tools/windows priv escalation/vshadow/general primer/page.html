What is Vshadow?<br/>
Vshadow (vshadow.exe) is a command line utility for managing volume shadow copies. &nbsp;This tool is included within the Windows SDK and is signed by Microsoft (more on this later).<br/>
<br/>
Vshadow has a lot of functionality, including the ability to execute scripts and invoke commands in support of volume shadow snapshot management. &nbsp;Not surprisingly, these capabilities can be abused for privileged-level evasion, persistence, and file extraction.<br/>
<br/>
In this blog post, we will discuss Vshadow command execution, auto-start persistence, and sensitive file copy using Vshadow to extract the Active Directory (AD) database for offline hash dumping and password cracking.<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion<br/>
In addition to monitoring for the indicators above, defenders may want to keep an eye out for odd Volume Shadow Service (VSS) behavior such as random creations/deletions and any activity that involves the AD database file (ntds.dit). &nbsp;Also, monitor for command invocation of vshadow.exe switches. &nbsp;File hashes and names may change, but “-nw -exec=” and “-p -nw” will likely persist. &nbsp;</body></html>
