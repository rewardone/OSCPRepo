<title>Tunneling / Relay / Pivot</title>
</head><body>In order to set up a Netcat relay, the following commands must be run on the<br/>
system hosting the Netcat relay:<br/>
<br/>
$mknod backpipe p<br/>
$nc –l –p 80 0&lt;backpipe | nc 192.168.128.128 80 1&gt;backpipe<br/>
<br/>
This establishes a Netcat listener on port 80. The Necat listener pipes any traffic<br/>
it receives to the Netcat client, which forwards the traffic to port 80 on the target web<br/>
server, 192.168.128.128. Any responses returned to the Netcat client from the web server<br/>
are sent via the backpipe to the Netcat listener, which forwards the response back to the<br/>
attacker<br/>
<br/>
Since, the Netcat listener only allows one connection at a time (Skoudis and Strand,<br/>
2014), when the testing software tries to open multiple connections simultaneously, the<br/>
extra connections are refused. This results in errors, which causes the Nikto scan to<br/>
terminate. The same behavior is seen when using Burp Suite and other tools, which by<br/>
default are multi-threaded and try to establish multiple connections simultaneously</body></html>
