<title>Mitigating/Detecting Mimikatz</title>
</head><body><ul><li>Benjamin Delpy publishes <a href="https://plusvic.github.io/yara/">YARA rules</a>&nbsp;for Mimikatz on the <a href="https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz">Mimkatz GitHub repository</a>.</li>
<li>Run AntiVirus software with the latest definition files. According to <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/en/">VirusTotal</a>, the <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/843b2c2e7a631c393a2763dd03d02166cee0631c07d10dae0a2e6a5816280dd8/analysis/">mimikatz.exe dated 11/11/2015</a>&nbsp;(32bit &amp; 64bit) is detected by <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/843b2c2e7a631c393a2763dd03d02166cee0631c07d10dae0a2e6a5816280dd8/analysis/">35/35 of the AV engines</a>. Renaming the file doesn’t change the scan results. Note that Benjamin has noted real-world results to be<a href="https://twitter.com/gentilkiwi/status/658344484615421954">&nbsp;less successful</a>. However, AV will usually flag the known bad files. AntiVirus is part of foundational security – the first layer in “defense in depth”.</li>
<li>Mimikatz (as of October) <a href="http://blog.cobaltstrike.com/2015/11/11/revolutionary-device-detects-mimikatz-use/">activates attached BusyLights</a>. <i>[implemented in Mimikatz version 2.0 alpha 20151008 (oe.eo) edition]</i></li>
<li>Leverage security software to identify processes that interact with LSASS. Security software that monitors for process injection may also be able to regularly detect Mimikatz use.</li>
<li><a href="https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Detecting+Mimikatz+Use+On+Your+Network/19311">HoneyTokens/HoneyHashes</a>&nbsp;involves placing special credentials in memory on a number of computers in the enterprise. These credentials are flagged so when anyone attempts to use them, a critical alert goes out. this requires some sort of push method as well as placing credentials that are attractive to an attacker. In theory, this could detect credential theft and use in the environment.</li>
<li>If the WDIGEST registry key (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest) is supposed to be set to “0” in the enterprise to prevent “clear-text” passwords from being stored in LSASS and there are systems where it was switched to “1”, this may be indicative of credential theft activity. This registry key is worth monitoring in your environment since an attacker may wish to set it to 0 to enable Digest password support which forces “clear-text” passwords to be placed in LSASS on any version of Windows from Windows 7/2008R2 up to Windows 10/2012R2 (probably 2016 as well).</li>
<li><a href="https://adsecurity.org/?p=1515">Forged Kerberos ticket detection is covered on this page I published in early 2015. These methods can detect Golden Tickets, Silver Tickets, and Trust Tickets</a>. I also have information on <a href="https://adsecurity.org/?p=763">how to detect MS14-068 Kerberos vulnerability exploitation</a>.</li>
<li>Enable LSA Protection on all Windows versions in the enterprise that supports it. This prevents Mimikatz from working “out-of-the-box” and requires use of the Mimikatz driver which logs events when it interacts with LSASS.</li>
<li>There are <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt431757%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">new/updated events starting with Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016</a>&nbsp;to potentially detect Mimikatz use: </li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li><b>Added a default process SACL to LSASS.exe</b>. In Windows 10, a default process SACL was added to LSASS.exe to log processes attempting to access LSASS.exe. The SACL is L”S:(AU;SAFA;0x0010;;;WD)”. You can enable this under Advanced Audit Policy Configuration\Object Access\Audit Kernel Object. This can help identify attacks that steal credentials from the memory of a process</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enable LSA protection</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>&nbsp;Open the Registry Editor (RegEdit.exe), and navigate to the registry key that is located at: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa and Set the value of the registry key to: “RunAsPPL”=dword:00000001.</li>
<li>Create a new GPO and browse to Computer Configuration, Preferences, Windows Settings. Right-click Registry, point to New, and then click Registry Item. The New Registry Properties dialog box appears. In the Hive list, click HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. In the Key Path list, browse to SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa.  In the Value name box, type RunAsPPL. In the Value type box, click the REG_DWORD. In the Value data box, type 00000001.Click OK.</li>
