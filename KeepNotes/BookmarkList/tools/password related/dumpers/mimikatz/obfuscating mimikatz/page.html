<title>Obfuscating Mimikatz</title>
</head><body>Anyone with Visual Studio can compile their own version. I built my own version of Mimikatz called “kitikatz” by replacing all instances of “mimikatz” with “kitikatz” and the detection rate at VirusTotal was not good (4/54). Windows Defender on my Windows 10 system detected it.  I then replaced “Benjamin Delpy” and “gentilkiwi” with the same words, just replacing the e’s with 3’s and the i’s with 1’s. The detection rate was <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/84b6cd8ccaa60a89c1375bec5044e6240d8a2db3f19fecd763749fa9a530470b/analysis/1449967355/">still poor (4/54)</a>. Windows Defender on my Windows 10 system did not detect it. So, your mileage will vary regarding detection. While <a href="http://blog.virustotal.com/2012/08/av-comparative-analyses-marketing-and.html">VirusTotal is not the best method to determine AV detection</a>, it is a relatively simple method to get some basic numbers.<br/>

Casey also has come up with many creative and sneaky ways to execute Mimikatz.<br/>

<li>Downloads and Executes Mimikatz In Memory From GitHub (Note: Subtee has discontinued his GitHub repo, so these links no longer work and have been removed)</li>
