[domainhunter](<a href="https://github.com/threatexpress/domainhunter">https://github.com/threatexpress/domainhunter</a>) | Python based tool was written to quickly query the Expireddomains.net search engine for expired/available domains with a previous history of use. It then optionally queries for domain reputation against services like Symantec WebPulse (BlueCoat), IBM X-Force, and Cisco Talos.<br/>

<a href="https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/dns-brute.html">Nmap</a> - Yes it's a port scanner, but it can bruteforce subdomains too (check nmap scripts)<br/>
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng">Recon-Ng</a> - The recon-ng framework has a <i>brute_hosts</i> module that allows to bruteforce subdomains.<br/>

<a href="https://github.com/fwaeytens/dnsenum">DNSenum </a>- Offers recursive and threaded subdomain enumeration.<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/infosec-au/altdns">AltDNS</a> - offers bruteforcing based on permutations of already found domains<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/jhaddix/domain">jhaddix/Domain</a>&nbsp;- enumall.py uses recon-ng, alt-dns web scraping, netcraft, and brute to find subdomains<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/guelfoweb/knock">Knock</a>&nbsp;- Python tool brute subdomains through wordlist. DNS zone transfer and bypass wildcard<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone">AQUATONE</a>&nbsp;| <ul><li style="list-style-type: none">AQUATONE is a set of tools for performing reconnaissance on domain names. It can discover subdomains on a given domain by using open sources as well as the more common subdomain dictionary brute force approach. After subdomain discovery, AQUATONE can then scan the hosts for common web ports and HTTP headers, HTML bodies and screenshots can be gathered and consolidated into a report for easy analysis of the attack surface.</li>

<a href="https://github.com/lorenzog/dns-parallel-prober">dns-parallel-prober</a>&nbsp;|<ul><li>This script is a proof of concept for a parallelised domain name prober. It creates a queue of threads and tasks each one to probe a sub-domain of the given root domain. At every iteration step each dead thread is removed and the queue is replenished as necessary.</li>
</ul>
<a href="https://github.com/Dhayalan96/enumall">enumall</a>&nbsp;| <ul><li>Script to enumerate subdomains, leveraging recon-ng. Uses google scraping, bing scraping, baidu scraping, yahoo scarping, netcraft, and bruteforces to find subdomains. Plus resolves to IP.</li>

TXDNS main goal is to expose a domain namespace trough a number of techniques: Typos: Mised, doouble and transposde keystrokes; TLD/ccSLD rotation; Dictionary attack; Full Brute-force attack using alpha, numeric or alphanumeric charsets; Reverse grinding.</li>

<b>Being smart</b><br/>
You also have to look at what kind of system the target has. Some web-apps give their clients their own subdomains. Like github.<br/>
Check out the homepage Often companies brag about their clients. You can use this to guess the subdomains of some clients.<br/>
