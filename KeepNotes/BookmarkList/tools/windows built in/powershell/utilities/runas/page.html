<title>RunAs</title>
</head><body>5) runas<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;This is sometimes very useful since it doesn't require admin privileges.<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;The command is part of windows, but if you don't have a GUI you can use<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp;powershell [8].<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Elevating the current session (or "moving" it to a different context) is not possible.<br/>
You can spawn a new process in the background or other with "Start-Process . . . -Verb RunAs"<br/>

Benjamin Armstrong posted an <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/virtual_pc_guy/archive/2010/09/23/a-self-elevating-powershell-script.aspx">excellent article about self-elevating PowerShell scripts.</a>&nbsp;There a few minor issue with his code; a modified version based on fixes suggested in the comment is below.<br/>
Basically it gets the identity associated with the current process, checks whether it is an administrator, and if it isn't, creates a new PowerShell process with administrator privileges and terminates the old process.<br/>
<br/>
# Get the ID and security principal of the current user account<br/>
$myWindowsID = [System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent();<br/>
$myWindowsPrincipal = New-Object System.Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal($myWindowsID);<br/>
<br/>
# Get the security principal for the administrator role<br/>
$adminRole = [System.Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]::Administrator;<br/>
<br/>
# Check to see if we are currently running as an administrator<br/>
if ($myWindowsPrincipal.IsInRole($adminRole))<br/>
{<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; # We are running as an administrator, so change the title and background colour to indicate this<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; $Host.UI.RawUI.WindowTitle = $myInvocation.MyCommand.Definition + "(Elevated)";<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; $Host.UI.RawUI.BackgroundColor = "DarkBlue";<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Clear-Host;<br/>
}<br/>
else {<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; # We are not running as an administrator, so relaunch as administrator<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; # Create a new process object that starts PowerShell<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; $newProcess = New-Object System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo "PowerShell";<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; # Specify the current script path and name as a parameter with added scope and support for scripts with spaces in it's path<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; $newProcess.Arguments = "&amp; '" + $script:MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path + "'"<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; # Indicate that the process should be elevated<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; $newProcess.Verb = "runas";<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; # Start the new process<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; [System.Diagnostics.Process]::Start($newProcess);<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; # Exit from the current, unelevated, process<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Exit;<br/>
}<br/>
<br/>
# Run your code that needs to be elevated here...<br/>
<br/>
Write-Host -NoNewLine "Press any key to continue...";<br/>
$null = $Host.UI.RawUI.ReadKey("NoEcho,IncludeKeyDown");</body></html>
