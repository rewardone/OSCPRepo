<title>Mitigation</title>
</head><body>For DiskShadow, Blue Teams and Network Defenders should consider the following:<br/>
<br/>
Monitor the Volume Shadow Service (VSS) for random shadow creations/deletions and any activity that involves the AD database file (ntds.dit).<br/>
Monitor for suspicious instances of System Event ID 7036 (“The Volume Shadow Copy service entered the running state”) and invocation of the VSSVC.exe process.<br/>
Monitor process creation events for diskshadow.exe and spawned child processes.<br/>
Monitor for process integrity. &nbsp;If diskshadow.exe runs at a medium integrity, that is likely a red flag.<br/>
Monitor for instances of diskshadow.exe on client endpoints. &nbsp;Unless there is a business need, diskshadow.exe *should* not be present on client Windows operating systems.<br/>
Monitor for new and interesting logical drive mappings.<br/>
Inspect suspicious “AutoRuns” entries. &nbsp;Scrutinize signed binaries and inspect script files.<br/>
Enforce Application Whitelisting. &nbsp;Strict policies may prevent DiskShadow pass-thru applications from executing.<br/>
Fight the good fight, and train your users. &nbsp;If they see something (e.g. a weird pop up window), they should say something!</body></html>
