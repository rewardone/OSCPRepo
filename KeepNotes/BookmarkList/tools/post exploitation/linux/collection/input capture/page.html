<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>logkeys is a linux keylogger. It is no more advanced than other available linux keyloggers, notably lkl and uberkey, but is a bit newer, more up to date, it doesn't unreliably repeat keys and it shouldn't crash your X. All in all, it just seems to work. It relies on event interface of the Linux input subsystem. Once completely set, it logs all common character and function keys, while also being fully aware of Shift and AltGr key modifiers.</li>

<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>SKeylogger is a simple keylogger. I had previously been using a few other open source keyloggers, but they stopped working when I upgraded my operating system. I tried to look through the code of those keyloggers, but it was undocumented, messy, and complex. I decided to make my own highly documented and very simple keylogger.</li>
