<title>Socks4a</title>
</head><body>-------------------------<br/>
Note: For Metasploit’s auxiliary/server/socks4a module to work across multiple<br/>
interfaces, the compromised host must have IP port forwarding enabled. IP port<br/>
forwarding is not enabled by default on Ubuntu servers. <br/>
The IP port forwarding setting can be checked with the command:<br/>
<br/>
#sysctl -a | grep ip_forward<br/>
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0<br/>
<br/>
IP port forwarding can be enabled temporarily, if permitted by the Rules of Engagement,<br/>
using:<br/>
<br/>
# echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward<br/>
<br/>
The setting is verified by:<br/>
<br/>
# sysctl -a | grep ip_forward<br/>
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1<br/>
<br/>
Enabling port forwarding generally will not be permitted by the Rules of Engagement. Portfwd can be used to send requests, though you won't be able to receive responses.<br/>

<br/>
Now that we have added a route to the target network we will take advantage of the socks4a auxiliary from within the framework. This auxiliary module provides a proxy server which uses the Metasploit framework routing which we have created to relay connections.snip<br/>

We quickly configure proxychains to match the port that we chose for our proxy server.<br/>

Since everything is setup we should be able to run external tools through our Metasploit created tunnel and directly attack our target network.<br/>
