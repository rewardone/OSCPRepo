<title>Substring Syntax Zero Length Vars</title>
</head><body>The same applies to zero-length environment variables. An environment variable can be accessed via %name%. If the environment variable has a length of zero, “cal%name%c” would be the same as “calc”. Since environment variables don’t have per default a length of zero, this can’t be used directly. However, it’s possible to call substring on the environment variable with a special syntax (:~start,end). The following figure shows the “windir” environment variable and how substring can be used with negativ values to get a zero-length variable returned:<br/>
