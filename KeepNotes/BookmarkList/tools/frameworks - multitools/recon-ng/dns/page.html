</head><body>In order to find subdomains we can use the recon-ng framework. It has the same basic structure as metasploit. You can learn more about this tool in the tools-section.<br/>
<br/>
recon-ng<br/>
use use recon/domains-hosts/<br/>
<br/>
This will give you a vast amount of alternatives.<br/>
show options<br/>
set source cnn.com<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All these subdomains will be saved in the hosts database, which you can access though: <br/>
show hosts<br/>
<br/>
If some of these subdomains are not given IPs automatically you can just run<br/>
use recon/hosts-hosts/resolve<br/>
run<br/>
<br/>
And it will resolve all the hosts in the hosts-file.</body></html>
