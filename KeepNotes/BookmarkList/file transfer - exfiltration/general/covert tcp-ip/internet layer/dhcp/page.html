<title>DHCP</title>
</head><body>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is another protocol on the Internet layer, that enables a<br/>
server to automatically assign an IP address to a computer from a defined range configured for a given network.<br/>
Rios et al [97] suggested and implemented the following reliable covert channels in the tool HIDE DHCP:<ul><li> by setting the 32-bit XID field, which is randomly generated by the client. This is stealthier, but withlimited bandwidth,</li>
<li> by using the SECS field, similarly like [42], for transmitting one bit,</li>
<li> by using the last 10B of the CHADDR field, when 48-bits Ethernet MAC address is used,</li>
<li> 64-byte SNAME and 128-byte FILE fields consist of null-terminated strings, thus hidden data might beincluded after this character without negatively impacting other clients or servers. They are set to null bythe operating system when they are not carrying their own data, but in some situations they might containinformation belonging to the Options field, when option 52 (Overload) is included.</li>
<li> by using variable-length Option Value field, and by the number of options used or the way options areordered. The size of the resulting DHCP messages can be suspicious.</li>
</ul>
