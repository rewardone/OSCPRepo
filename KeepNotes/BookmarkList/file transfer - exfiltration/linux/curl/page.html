<br/>
curl is a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of the supported protocols (DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP). The command is designed to work without user interaction. <br/>
curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authentication, FTP upload, HTTP post, SSL connections, cookies, file transfer resume, Metalink, and more. As you will see below, the number of features will make your head spin! <br/>
curl is powered by libcurl for all transfer-related features. See libcurl(3) for details. <br/>

So many options...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
--proxy-insecure <br/>
Same as <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#-k">-k, --insecure</a>&nbsp;but used in HTTPS proxy context. <br/>
Added in 7.52.0. <br/>
--socks4 &lt;host[:port]&gt; <br/>
Use the specified SOCKS4 proxy. If the port number is not specified, it is assumed at port 1080. <br/>
This option overrides any previous use of <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#-x">-x, --proxy</a>, as they are mutually exclusive. <br/>
Since 7.21.7, this option is superfluous since you can specify a socks4 proxy with <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#-x">-x, --proxy</a>&nbsp;using a socks4:// protocol prefix. <br/>
Since 7.52.0, <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#--preproxy">--preproxy</a>&nbsp;can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at the same time <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#-x">-x, --proxy</a>&nbsp;is used with an HTTP/HTTPS proxy. In such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then connects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy. <br/>
If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. <br/>
Added in 7.15.2. <br/>
--socks4a &lt;host[:port]&gt; <br/>
Use the specified SOCKS4a proxy. If the port number is not specified, it is assumed at port 1080. <br/>
This option overrides any previous use of <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#-x">-x, --proxy</a>, as they are mutually exclusive. <br/>
Since 7.21.7, this option is superfluous since you can specify a socks4a proxy with <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#-x">-x, --proxy</a>&nbsp;using a socks4a:// protocol prefix. <br/>
Since 7.52.0, <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#--preproxy">--preproxy</a>&nbsp;can be used to specify a SOCKS proxy at the same time <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#-x">-x, --proxy</a>&nbsp;is used with an HTTP/HTTPS proxy. In such a case curl first connects to the SOCKS proxy and then connects (through SOCKS) to the HTTP or HTTPS proxy. <br/>
If this option is used several times, the last one will be used. <br/>
Added in 7.18.0. <br/>
--socks5-basic <br/>
Tells curl to use username/password authentication when connecting to a SOCKS5 proxy. The username/password authentication is enabled by default. Use <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#--socks5-gssapi">--socks5-gssapi</a>&nbsp;to force GSS-API authentication to SOCKS5 proxies. <br/>
Added in 7.55.0. <br/>
