<title>631: Cups</title>
</head><body>Common UNIX Printing System has become the standard for sharing printers on a linux-network. You will often see port 631 open in your priv-esc enumeration when you run netstat. You can log in to it here: http://localhost:631/admin<br/>
<br/>
You authenticate with the OS-users.<br/>
Find version. Test cups-config --version. If this does not work surf to http://localhost:631/printers and see the CUPS version in the title bar of your browser.<br/>
There are vulnerabilities for it so check your searchsploit.</body></html>
