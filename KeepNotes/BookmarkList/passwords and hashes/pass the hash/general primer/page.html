<br/>
Pass The Hash is a technique utilized by penetration testers as well as attackers after an initial foothold to authenticate to other networked Windows machines with compromised NT LAN Manager (NTLM) password hashes. &nbsp;This is possible due to how Windows implements its NTLM authentication scheme. &nbsp;After login, attempts to authenticate to other networked computers, file shares, and other resources with NTLM will result in a challenge/response which includes the user name and password hash (computed with the original challenge value). &nbsp;No plaintext password ever exchanged! &nbsp; These hashes are stored in several places. &nbsp;For local accounts, each machine will store the associated hash values in the Security Account Management (SAM) Database. In a Domain environment, hashes for all accounts in Active Directory are stored on the Domain Controller in a file called “NTDS.dit”. &nbsp;Finally, credentials can also be stored in memory (plaintext in some cases) during interactive sessions such as logging in at the console or &nbsp;through remote sessions (RDP).<br/>
<br/>
It is important to note that accessing these credentials requires privileged access (SYSTEM, Local/Domain Administrators) to the SAM database for local accounts or Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process for interactive logins.<br/>
<br/>
Windows will gladly accept NTLM hash values in many situations, such as accessing a network resource by its IP address (vs. hostname) or connecting to a device that isn’t joined to the Domain. &nbsp;The only only time hashes would not be exchanged would be when requesting network resources in a Kerberos-exclusive environment, but that type of implementation is rare and can be problematic for many organizations to implement.</body></html>
