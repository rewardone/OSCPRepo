<title>PsExec</title>
</head><body>At a high-level, the <b>SysInternals PsExec</b>&nbsp;program works as follows:<br/>
<ul><li>Connects to the hidden ADMIN$ share (mapping to the C:\Windows folder) on the remote system via SMB</li>
<li>Utilizes the Service Control Manager (SCM) to start the PsExecsvc service and enable a named pipe on the remote system</li>
<li>Input/output redirection of the console is achieved via the created named pipe</li>
</ul>
<br/>
In order to use PsExec with captured hashes, you need the help of a tool like <a href="http://www.ampliasecurity.com/research/windows-credentials-editor/">Windows Credential Editor (WCE)</a>. &nbsp;This presents it’s own set of issues, as you will be required to drop another executable to disk and risk detection. &nbsp;That being said, the following is a good reference if you are interested in learning more:<a href="http://fuzzynop.blogspot.com/2012/09/pass-hash-without-metasploit.html">&nbsp;Pass The Hash Without Metasploit.</a>&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
<b>Metasploit’s PSExec Module</b><br/>
<br/>
There are several modules within the Metasploit Framework that leverage PsExec-style techniques; however, when you hear someone refer to the PSExec module, they are most likely referring to: exploit/windows/smb/psexec. &nbsp;This is the module that allows for code execution on the target machine, returning a payload (usually a Meterpreter shell) to the attacker.<br/>
<br/>
While similar in functionality to Sysinternal’s PsExec, the Metasploit Framework’s PSExec Module has a few key differences and at a high-level performs the following actions. &nbsp;By default, the module takes the following actions:<br/>
<ul><li>Creates a randomly-named service executable with an embedded payload</li>
<li>Connects to the hidden ADMIN$ share on the remote system via SMB</li>
<li>Drops malicious service executable onto the share</li>
<li>Utilizes the SCM to start a randomly-named service</li>
<li>Service loads the malicious code into memory and executes it</li>
<li>Metasploit payload handler receives payload and establishes session</li>
<li>Module cleans up after itself, stopping the service and deleting the executable.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
However, the most important modification that a penetration tester can make is creating and linking to a custom service executable instead of relying on the executable templates provided by the Metasploit Framework. &nbsp;Failure to do so greatly increases the risk of detection by the target system’s anti-virus solution once the executable is dropped to disk. &nbsp;You can read more about why this is in my September 2015 blog post: &nbsp;<a href="https://www.toshellandback.com/2015/09/30/anti-virus/">A/V Ain’t Got Nothing On Me</a>!<br/>
<br/>
<b>The Power Of PowerShell</b><br/>
<br/>
This is all well and good, but what if we could use PSExec tehniques but avoid the whole mess of dropping a service executable to disk and risking detection? &nbsp;Only in your wildest dreams, you say? NAH, BRAH… REAL LIFE!<br/>
<br/>
There is a PowerShell-based version of PSExec within the Metasploit Framework: <b>exploit/windows/smb/psexec_psh.</b><br/>
<br/>
This module allows for PSExec-style functionality but with the added bonus of everything being executed in memory and never having to touch disk! &nbsp;If this sounds familiar, Raphael Mudge (@armitagehacker) implemented a very similar approach within Cobalt Strike. &nbsp;At a high-level, the psexec_psh module works as follows:<br/>
<ul><li>Embed stager into a PowerShell script that will inject the payload into memory</li>
<li>Compress and Base64 encode the PowerShell script</li>
<li>Wrap encoded script into a PowerShell one-liner that decodes and deflates</li>
<li>Connect to ADMIN$ share on target machine over SMB and run the one-liner</li>
<li>Embedded script is passed into memory via PowerShell’s Invoke-Expression (IEX)</li>
<li>Script creates a new service and passes stager payload into it</li>
<li>Metasploit payload handler receives payload and establishes session</li>
<li>Module cleans up after itself by tearing down the service</li>
</ul>
<br/>
This past Spring / Summer, I noticed that the psexec_psh module had been listed as ‘deprecated’ within Metasploit and that the original psexec module had been updated to include the PowerShell functionality. &nbsp;The updated psexec module first checks for the presence of PowerShell on the host, and if found, will leverage the method described above. &nbsp;If PowerShell is not installed on the target, the module will revert to the “old school” method of dropping a service executable onto the victim machine. &nbsp;The PowerShell-related commands within the psexec module can be found under the Advanced settings.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, the psexec_psh module appears to have been resurrected, no longer being listed as deprecated. &nbsp;Confused, I reached out to OJ Reeves (@thecolonial), a well-known contributor to the Metasploit Project, for clarification. &nbsp;I learned that while the PowerShell-specific code is basically identical between the two modules (as I had originally suspected), there have been circumstances where the psexec module fails to execute properly while the psexec_psh module is successful. &nbsp;Until the reliability of the code within the psexec module matches that of psexec_psh, it would appear that the latter is here to stay.<br/>
