<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>This is the way passwords are stored on modern Windows systems, and can be obtained by <b>dumping the SAM</b>&nbsp;database, or using Mimikatz. They are also stored on domain controllers in the <b>NTDS file</b>. These are the hashes you can use to <b>pass-the-hash</b>.<br/>
<br/>
Usually people call this the NTLM hash (or just NTLM), which is misleading, as Microsoft refers to this as the NTHash (at least in some places). I personally recommend to call it the NTHash, to try to avoid confusion.<br/>
