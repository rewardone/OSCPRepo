<title>ADD (mtds.dit)</title>
</head><body>The Active Directory domain database is stored in the <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc961761.aspx">ntds.dit file</a>&nbsp;(stored in c:\Windows\NTDS by default, but often on a different logical drive). The AD database is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Jet_Database_Engine">Jet database engine</a>&nbsp;which uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Storage_Engine">Extensible Storage Engine (ESE)</a>&nbsp;which provides data storage and indexing services; ESE level indexing enables object attributes to be quickly located. ESE ensures the database complies with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">ACID </a>(Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable) – all operations in a transaction complete or none do. The AD ESE database is very fast and reliable.<br/>

Note: Microsoft also uses the Jet database for Exchange mailbox databases.<br/>

Active Directory <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/ad/archive/2008/07/11/loading-the-active-directory-database-into-ram.aspx">loads parts of the ntds.dit file in (LSASS protected) memory</a>&nbsp;with the caching based on LRU-K algorithm ensuring most frequently accessed data is in memory, for increased performance, thus improving read performance the second time. Database changes are performed in memory, written to the transaction log, and then there’s a lazy commit to the database file later.The checkpoint file (edb.chk) keeps track of transactions written to this point.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
The “<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc772829(v=ws.10).aspx">version store</a>” is a copy of an object’s instance while the data is being read from memory which enables updates to be performed without changing the read-data (ESE transactional view). Once the read operation completes, that instance of the version store ends.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
While Active Directory is comprised of <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc961591.aspx">three directory partitions, Domain, Configuration, and Schema</a>, this is simply an abstracted view of the database data. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc772829(v=ws.10).aspx">The ntds.dit file is comprised of three main tables: Data Table, Link Table, and the SD Table</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Data Table &nbsp;</b><br/>
The data table contains all the information in the Active Directory data store: users, groups, application-specific data, and any other data that is stored in Active Directory after its installation. The data table can be thought of as having rows (each representing an instance of an object, such as a user) and columns (each representing an attribute in the schema, such as GivenName). For each attribute in the schema, the table contains a column, called a field. Field sizes can be fixedor variable. Fixed-size fields contain an integer or long integer as the data type. Variable-size fields typically hold string types, for example, Unicode strings. The database allocates only as much space as a variable-size field needs: 16 bits for a 1-character Unicode string, 160 bits for a 10-character Unicode string, and so on.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
The database space that is used to store an object depends on the number of attributes for which values are set and the size of the values. For example, if the administrator creates two user objects (User1 and User2), sets only the minimum attributes on them, and then later adds a 10-character description to User2, the User2 space is approximately 80 bytes bigger than the User1 space (20 bytes for the 10 characters, plus metadata on the newly generated attribute).<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
Database records cannot span database pages; therefore, each object is limited to 8 kilobytes (KB). However, some attribute values of an object do not count fully against this limit. Long, variable-length values can be stored on a different page than the object record, leaving behind only a 9-byte reference. In this way, an object and all its attribute values can be much larger than 8 KB.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Link</b>&nbsp;<b>Table</b>&nbsp; <br/>
The link table contains data that represents linked attributes, which contain values that refer to other objects in Active Directory. An example is the MemberOf attribute on a user object, which contains values that reference groups to which the user belongs. The link table is much smaller than the data table.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>SD Table &nbsp;</b><br/>
The SD Table contains data that represents inherited security descriptors for each object. With the introduction of the SD table in Windows Server 2003 or later, inherited security descriptors no longer have to be duplicated on each object that inherits security descriptors. Instead, inherited security descriptors are stored in the SD table and linked to the appropriate objects.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Note, that in the previous list there are numerous fields that are described as encrypted. The purpose of this encryption is to provide protection against offline data extraction.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
The solution introduced by Microsoft in order to provide this protection is complex and composed of 3 layers of encryption of which 2 layers use RC4 and the third layer uses DES.<br/>
