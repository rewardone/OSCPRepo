</head><body>Internet Explorer 4.00 - 6.00: The passwords are stored in a secret location in the Registry known as the "Protected Storage". The base key of the Protected Storage is located under the following key: "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Protected Storage System Provider". In order to view the subkeys of this key in RegEdit, you must do the same process as explained for the LSA secrets. <br/>
Even when you browse the above key in the Registry Editor (RegEdit), you won't be able to watch the passwords, because they are encrypted. Also, this key cannot easily moved from one computer to another, like you do with regular Registry keys. <br/>
