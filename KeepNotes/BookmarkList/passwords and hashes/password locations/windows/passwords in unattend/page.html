<title>Passwords in Unattend</title>
</head><body>If administrators fail to clean up after this process, an EXtensible Markup Language (XML) file called Unattend is left on the local system. &nbsp;This file contains all the configuration settings that were set during the installation process, some of which can include the configuration of local accounts, to include Administrator accounts!<br/>
<br/>
While it’s a good idea to search the entire drive, Unattend files are likely to be found within the following folders:<br/>
<br/>
C:\unattend.txt<br/>
C:\Windows\Panther\<br/>
C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend\<br/>
C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend\Unattended.xml<br/>
C:\Windows\System32\<br/>
C:\Windows\System32\sysprep\<br/>
C:\sysprep.inf<br/>
C:\sysprep\sysprep.xml<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Note: In addition to Unattend.xml files, be on the lookout for sysprep.xml and sysprep.inf files on the file system. <br/>
<br/>
Microsoft appends “Password” to all passwords within Unattend files before encoding them; therefore, our Local Administrator password is in fact just “P@ssword123!”.<br/>
