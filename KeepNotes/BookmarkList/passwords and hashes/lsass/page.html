</head><body>Local Security Authority Subsystem Service<br/>
<br/>
LSASS is a process in Windows that is responsible for enforcing the security policy on the system. It verifies users logging on to a Windows computer or server, handles password changes, and creates access tokens. It also writes to the Windows Security Log. lsass.exe is a crucial system file and is located in the System32 folder. Forcible termination of lsass.exe will result in the Welcome screen losing its account(s). <br/>
<br/>
This is meant to facilitate single sign-on ensuring a user isn't prompted each time resource access is requested. The credential data may include Kerberos tickets, NTLM password hashes, LM password hashes (if the password is &lt;15 characters), and even clear-text passwords (to support WDigest and SSP authentication among other). <br/>
<br/>
By default Windows Server 2008 and Winodws Vista no longer generate LM hashes unless explicitly enabled.<br/>
By default in Windows 8.1 and Server 2012R2, the LM hash and "clear-text" passwords are no longer in memory.<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;This functionality was 'back-ported' to earlier versions of Windows in kb2871997<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;&#09;WDigestUseLogonCredential must be set to 0 (Digest Disabled)<br/>
