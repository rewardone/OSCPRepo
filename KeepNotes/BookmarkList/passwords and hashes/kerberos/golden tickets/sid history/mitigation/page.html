<title>Mitigation</title>
</head><body>It has been noted that enabling SID Filtering between trusts in an Active Directory forest would mitigate this since SID History wouldn’t work. That may be true, though there’s a couple of potential issues with this approach: <br/>
<br/>
1) I have never seen this configured in a production environment, <br/>
2) I’m not sure of Microsoft’s support posture on this, and <br/>
3) enabling SID filtering on trusts within an AD forest <i>may</i>&nbsp;break applications that rely on universal group membership across domains (this could be a pretty big deal since universal groups are typically used frequently in multi-domain AD forests). <br/>
<br/>
These may seem like minor issues, but I have seen several large enterprise AD environments that break when non-standard approaches are taken since the developers didn’t take the config into account when testing.<br/>

Note that the Active Directory domain is <i>not </i>the security boundary; the AD forest is. This means that if you need account isolation, you need AD forests, not domains in an AD forest.<br/>
