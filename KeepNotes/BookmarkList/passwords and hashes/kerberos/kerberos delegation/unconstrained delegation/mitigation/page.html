<title>Mitigation</title>
</head><body> Mitigation: <ul><li>&nbsp;Don’t use Kerberos Unconstrained Delegation – configure servers that require delegation with Constrained Delegation.</li>
<li>Configure all elevated administrator accounts to be “Account is sensitive and cannot be delegated”.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn466518.aspx">“Protected Users” group</a>, available starting with Windows Server 2012 R2 Domain Functional Level also mitigates against this issue since delegation is not allowed for accounts in this group.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
When the Protected Users’ group account is upgraded to the Windows Server 2012 R2 domain functional level, domain controller-based protections are automatically applied. Members of the Protected Users group who authenticate to a Windows Server 2012 R2 domain can no longer authenticate by using:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;Default credential delegation (CredSSP). Plain text credentials are not cached even when the <b>Allow delegating default credentials</b>&nbsp;Group Policy setting is enabled.</li>
<li>Windows Digest. Plain text credentials are not cached even when Windows Digest is enabled.</li>
<li>NTLM. The result of the NT one-way function, NTOWF, is not cached.</li>
<li>Kerberos long-term keys. The keys from Kerberos initial TGT requests are typically cached so the authentication requests are not interrupted. For accounts in this group, Kerberos protocol verifies authentication at each request..</li>
<li>Sign-in offline. A cached verifier is not created at sign-in.</li>
</ul>
