<title>Access Kerberos With NTLM Hash</title>
</head><body>High-Level Anatomy of an Attack <ul><li>&nbsp;Attacker uses a publicly-available free penetration testing tool (such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318223528/http://www.ampliasecurity.com/research/wcefaq.html">WCE</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150318223528/https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz">Mimikatz</a>) that steals an authentication component, named NTLM hash, from the employee’s device. The NTLM hash resides by default on all devices that connect to enterprise resources.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Since this authentication component is known to be a security hazard which leads to identity theft attacks, through the notorious Pass-the-Hash (PtH) attack, protections have been placed to prevent its misuse. For example, many enterprises try to limit the use Active Directory’s older – yet still enabled by default –authentication protocol (i.e. NTLM). In other scenarios, enterprises log and audit NTLM activity.</li>
<li>The attacker forces the client to authenticate to Active Directory using a weaker encryption protocol. At this stage, the attacker uses the Active Directory flaw where the encryption protocol relies on the NTLM hash.</li>
<li>&nbsp;This activity is not logged in system and 3rd party logs- even those that specifically log NTLM activity. As a result, no alerts, or forensic data, ever indicate that an attack takes place.</li>
<li>The attacker proves its so-called legitimate identity to Active Directory using the weaker authentication protocol. Consequently, the attacker is able to: </li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Authenticate themselves to restricted services</li>
<li>Change the password of the victim</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The attacker uses the changed password to fully steal the identity of the victim and access all of the victim’s enterprise resources.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Both the NTLM and Kerberos protocols are based on using the user’s password as a proof of the user’s identity. The key difference between them is the way they use of the user’s password:<br/>
&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;The NTLM protocol computes a relatively weak cryptographic hash function based on the user’s password to create the <b><i>NTLM hash</i></b>. From that point on, the protocol uses that NTLM hash as a replacement for the user’s password in order to authenticate to various services.</li>
<li>Kerberos works by exchanging the password for a ticket (formally known as the TGT – Ticket Granting Ticket). This time around, Kerberos uses safer cryptographic methods than that of NTLM’s. The Kerberos ticket contains all of the user’s relevant authentication and authorization information. This information enables the KDC (i.e. the Key Distribution Center. Consider it as the Kerberos’ “key master” which grants specific access to other organizational services) to rely solely on the ticket information for the user’s authentication and authorization.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
The Active Directory Vulnerability: NTLM’s Hash is Kerberos’ RC4-HMAC Key<br/>
The thing is that Windows supplemented the Kerberos standard with an encryption method that allows users to obtain a ticket with… the older NTLM hash<br/>
<br/>
Technically, this upgrade was achieved by adding support in Kerberos for the encryption algorithm named RC4-HMAC. <br/>
&nbsp;<b>And herein lies the problem: the RC4-HMAC encryption algorithm uses the NTLM hash as its key.</b><br/>
<br/>
The side-effect of this vulnerability? Attackers can obtain a <b>valid Kerberos ticket</b>&nbsp;if they are able to obtain a user’s NTLM hash.<br/>
<br/>
The reason is that they can change the encryption settings from the default, stronger, AES encryption to the weaker RC4-HMAC and use the stolen NTLM hash as the Kerberos’ password encryption key. As a result, attackers can prove their identity to Active Directory and in turn, receive a valid Kerberos ticket.</body></html>
