<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>tl;dr: At the heart of this matter is the delegation of privileges – allowing one user to pretend to be another in Active Directory. This delegation (currently) comes in two flavors: unconstrained and constrained delegation.<br/>
<br/>
It starts with the TRUSTED_TO_AUTHENTICATE_FOR_DELEGATION (T2A4D) User-Account-Control flag. It applies to user accounts, and the repercussions it can have when configured within a Windows environment.<br/>
<br/>
The User-Account-Control attribute, not to be confused with the Windows UAC mechanism, sets particular attributes on Active Directory accounts, such as if the account is disabled, locked out, or if the user's password never expires. The T24AD flag, when applied to a user account, is used for a Kerberos mechanism known as 'Protocol Transition'. It was created to solve a specific problem in which users authenticate to a service that doesn't support Kerberos authentication, but the service wishes to delegate their tokens to secondary services, e.g. MSSQL or CIFS, to access resources whilst impersonating those users.<br/>
<br/>
To allow this process to occur, the Kerberos protocol extension 'Service For User To Self' (S4U2Self) was implemented by Microsoft. This extension allows a service to request a token for another user, by supplying their user principal name, but without supplying a password. When the user account has the T24AD flag, these tokens can be requested with the 'forwardable' attribute which allows the service to authenticate with these tokens to other services.<br/>
<br/>
Now unconstrained delegation is bad, <a href="nbk:///7c2ddfa4-ab4e-436f-9abc-520444c2bc68">mmkay</a>? So Microsoft ensured that these tokens could only be used for specific services which are configured on the user account via the 'Service For User To Proxy' (S4U2Proxy) extension. This setting is controlled by the <b>msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo</b>&nbsp;attribute on the user account. It contains a list of <b>Service Principal Names</b>&nbsp;that point to which Kerberos services the user can forward these tokens to (the same way normal Kerberos Constrained Delegation is performed). <br/>
<br/>
For example, you wish for your web service to access a file share for users so you would specify that the service account has an ms-DS-AllowedToDelegateTo value of "cifs/fs.contoso.com". This in effect allows the web service account to authenticate to the CIFS/SMB file share as any user in the domain, so requires a lot of trust in that application.<br/>

<br/>
<ul><li>1. The user authenticates to the web service using a non-Kerberos compatible authentication mechanism</li>
<li>2. The web service requests a ticket from the Key Distribution Center (KDC) for the 'user' account without supplying a password, as the svc_web account</li>
<li>3. The KDC checks the svc_web userAccountControl value for the TRUSTED_TO_AUTHENTICATE_FOR_DELEGATION flag, and that the target user is not blocked for delegation. If OK it returns a forwadable ticket for the 'user' account (S4U2Self)</li>
<li>4. The service then passes this ticket back to the KDC and requests a service ticket for the cifs/fs.contoso.com service</li>
<li>5. The KDC checks the msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo field on the svc_web account. If the service is listed it will return a service ticket for the file share (S4U2Proxy)</li>
<li>6. The web service can now authenticate to the file share as the 'user' account using the supplied ticket</li>
</ul>
