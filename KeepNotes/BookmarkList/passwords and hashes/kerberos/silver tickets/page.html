<title>Silver Tickets</title>
</head><body>&nbsp;1) Service tickets destined for something the target computer deals with (file shares, rpc calls, etc) use the target computer's AD account to sign the service ticket.  The computer account is (by default) changed every 30 days or so and has a long random unicode password.  You in all likelihood will never be able to guess this password.  However, with local admin on the box or physical access, they are trivial to recover. &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; 2) Service tickets destined for a service running as a different account (SQL server, Exchange Server, etc) will use the service account password for that particular service as the signing key for Kerberos requests.  There is a chance you can guess these passwords, since they are service accounts.  Tim Medin's research focuses on getting something to crack offline by creating a fake SPN (service principal name) and requesting service ticket(s) ( https://github.com/nidem/kerberoast / http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon4/t120-attacking-microsoft-kerberos-kicking-the-guard-dog-of-hades-tim-medin ) &nbsp;<br/>

&nbsp; Silver tickets allow an attacker to generate arbitrary service tickets when the attacker has the service account hash / password.  PAC validation is disabled by default for accounts running as services.  For more details, refer to one of my previous posts which quotes the official MS specs : http://passing-the-hash.blogspot.com/2014/09/pac-validation-20-minute-rule-and.html &nbsp;</body></html>
