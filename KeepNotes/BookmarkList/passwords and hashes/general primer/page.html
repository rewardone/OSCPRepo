</head><body>LM- and NT-hashes are ways Windows stores passwords. NT is confusingly also known as NTLM. Can be cracked to gain password, or used to pass-the-hash.<br/>
<br/>
NTLMv1/v2 are challenge response protocols used for authentication in Windows environments. These use the NT-hash in the algorithm, which means it can be used to recover the password through Brute Force/Dictionary attacks. They can also be used in a relay attack, see byt3bl33d3r’s article [1].<br/>

If you’re still confused, I would recommend reading the Wikipedia articles. I do hope this intro clears up the confusing language and can somehow help you.</body></html>
