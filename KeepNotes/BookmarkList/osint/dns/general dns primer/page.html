<title>General DNS Primer</title>
</head><body><br/>
This is the best article I have found about how the DNS-system works. Form the highest to the lowest level <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-dns-terminology-components-and-concepts">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-dns-terminology-components-and-concepts</a><br/>
<br/>
<b>A - records</b><br/>
A stands for address<br/>
<br/>
The A record maps a name to one or more IP addresses, when the IP are known and stable. So that would be 123.244.223.222 =&gt; example.com<br/>
<br/>
<b>AAAA</b>&nbsp;- points to a IPv6 Record<br/>
<br/>
<b>CNAME</b><br/>
The CNAME record connects a name to another name. An example of that would be:<br/>
www.example.com,CNAME,www.example.com.cdn.cloudflare.net<br/>
<br/>
Another example is. If you have the domains mail.example.com and webmail.example.com. You can have webmail.example.com point to mail.example.com. So anyone visiting webmail.example.com will see the same thing as mail.example.com. It will NOT redirect you. Just show you the same content.<br/>
<br/>
Another typical usage of CNAME is to link www.example.com to example.com<br/>
<br/>
CNAME is quite convenient. Because if you change the A-record. The IP-address, you don't need to change the other subdomains, like ftp.example.com or www.example.com. Since they both point to example.com, which is a A-record and points directly to the IP.<br/>
<br/>
Another note. If foo.example.com points to bar.example.com, that mean that bar.example.com is the CNAME (Canonical/real/actual Name) of foo.example.com.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Alias</b><br/>
Kind of like CNAME in that it points to another name, not an IP.<br/>
<br/>
<b>MX</b>&nbsp;- Mail exchange<br/>

<br/>
<b>DNS Zone Transfer Attack</b><br/>
Sometimes DNS servers are misconfigured. The DNS server contains a Zone file which it uses to replicate the map of a domain. They should be configured so that only the replicating DNS-server can access it, but sometimes it is misconfigured so anyone can request the zone file, and thereby recieve the whole list of subdomains. <br/>
This can also be done with tools such as dnsrecon and dnsenum.<br/>

<br/>
SOA (Start of Authority): Identify DNS server responsible for domain information<br/>
SRV (Service): Identify services such as directory services<br/>
PTR (Pointer): Maps IP addresses to hostnames<br/>
NS (Name Server): Identifies other name servers for the domain<br/>
AXFR (Zone Transfer): Can leak all the Sub-Domain Names registered for the domain<br/>
HINO (host information): associates an arbitrary set of information with a domain name, formerly used to indicate system types<br/>
