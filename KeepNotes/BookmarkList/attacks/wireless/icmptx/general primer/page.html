<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>In many restaurants, hotels, airports, airplanes, and cafes, they have open authentication on the wireless AP, but once you connect to the AP, you are sent to a proxy that asks you for your credentials. This is very common in many commercial establishments around the world. To obtain the necessary credentials, there is usually charge associated with it.<br/>
<br/>
What if you didn't have a credit card, or forgot your credit card, and needed to access the internet? You still may be able to, if the server accepts ICMP (ping) and you are patient.<br/>

In addition, imagine a scenario where you need to stealthily retrieve a file, send a message, or retrieve a message, in say, a cyber espionage or cyber warfare situation, while barely leaving a trace of your activity. This may be your method of choice.</body></html>
