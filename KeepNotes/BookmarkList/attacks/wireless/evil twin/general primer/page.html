<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>Our first task will be to creating an evil twin access point. Many new hackers are anxious to crack Wi-Fi passwords to gain some free bandwidth (don't worry, we'll get to that), but there are so many other Wi-Fi hacks that are far more powerful and put so much more at risk than a bit of bandwidth.<br/>

What's an Evil Twin AP?<br/>
The evil twin AP is an access point that looks and acts just like a legitimate AP and entices the end-user to connect to our access point. Our aircrack-ng suite has a tool, airbase-ng, that can be used to convert our wireless adapter into an access point. This is a powerful client-side hack that will enable us to see all of the traffic from the client and conduct a man-in-the middle attack.</body></html>
