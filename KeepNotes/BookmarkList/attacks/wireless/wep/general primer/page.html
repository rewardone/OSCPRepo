<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>When Wi-Fi was first developed and popularized in the late '90s, security was not a major concern. Unlike wired connections, anyone could simply connect to a Wi-Fi access point (AP) and steal bandwidth, or worse—sniff the traffic.<br/>
<br/>
The first attempt at securing these access points was termed Wired Equivalent Privacy, or simply WEP. This encryption method has been around for quite awhile and a number of weaknesses have been discovered. It has been largely replaced by WPA and WPA2.<br/>
<br/>
Despite these known weaknesses, there are still a significant number of these legacy APs in use. I was recently (July 2013) working at a major U.S. Department of Defense contractor in Northern Virginia, and in that building, probably a quarter of the wireless APs were still using WEP!</body></html>
