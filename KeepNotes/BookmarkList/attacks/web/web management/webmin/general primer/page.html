Webmin is a program that simplifies the process of managing a Linux or Unix system. Normally you need to manually edit configuration files and run commands to create accounts, set up a web server or manage email forwarding. Webmin lets you perform these tasks through an easy to use web interface, and automatically updates all of the required configuration files for you. This makes the job of administering your system much easier.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the things that you can do with Webmin are :<br/>
<br/>
Create, edit and delete Unix accounts on your system.<br/>
Export files and directories to other systems with the NFS protocol.<br/>
Set up Disk Quotas to control how much space users can use up with their files.<br/>
Install, view and remove Software Packages in RPM and other formats.<br/>
Change your system's IP address, DNS Server settings and routing configuration.<br/>
Set up a Linux Firewall to protect your computer, or to give hosts on an internal LAN access to the Internet.<br/>
Create and configure virtual web servers for the Apache Webserver.<br/>
Manage databases, tables and fields in a MySQL or PostgreSQL Database Server<br/>
Share files with Windows systems by configuring Samba Windows File Sharing.</body></html>
