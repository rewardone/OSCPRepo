</head><body>&nbsp;Password Cracker <a href="http://www.red-database-security.com/software/checkpwd.html">checkpwd</a>&nbsp;will crack the DES-based hashes from Oracle 8, 9, 10+.<br/>
Oracle 11 and 12 hashes are in the spare4 table. <br/>
<br/>
S: hashes are a hash plus a salt. The salt is the last 20 chars. Hashcat type 112. <br/>
<br/>
H: seems to be used for digest auth in XDB. The username is uppercased, then the MD5 hash is calculated from it, and 'XDB' and password are separated by colons:<br/>
<br/>
import hashlib<br/>
m = hashlib.md5()<br/>
m.update('DEMO:XDB:epsilon')<br/>
m.hexdigest().upper()<br/>
'DC9894A01797D91D92ECA1DA66242209'<br/>
<br/>
This makes it possible to attack built-in user passwords using pre calculated hashes for dictionary words prefixed with constants like 'SYSTEM:XDB:'.<br/>
<br/>
T: processed via PBKDF2 followed by SHA512. The actual hash is the last portion of that string, following the "T:" Loading it into hashcat just requires you to set the hash type to -m 12300</body></html>
