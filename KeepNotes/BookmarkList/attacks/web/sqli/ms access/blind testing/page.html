<title>Blind Testing</title>
</head><body>Blind SQL Injection vulnerabilities are by no means the most easily exploitable SQL injections while testing real-life applications. In case of recent versions of MS Access, it is also not feasible to execute shell commands or read/write arbitrary files.<br/>
In case of blind SQL injections, the attacker can only infer the result of the query by evaluating time differences or application responses. It is supposed that the reader already knows the theory behind blind SQL injection attacks, as the remaining part of this section will focus on MS Access specific details.<br/>
<br/>
The following example is used:<br/>
&nbsp;http://www.example.com/index.php?myId=[sql]<br/>
where the id parameter is used within the following query:<br/>
&nbsp;SELECT * FROM orders WHERE [id]=$myId<br/>
<br/>
Let's consider the myId parameter vulnerable to blind SQL injection. As an attacker, we want to extract the content of column 'username' in the table 'users', assuming that we have already disclosed the database schema.<br/>
<br/>
A typical query that can be used to infer the first character of the username of the 10th rows is:<br/>
http://www.example.com/index.php?id=IIF((select%20MID(LAST(username),1,1)%20from%20(select%20TOP%2010%20username%20from%20users))='a',0,'no') <br/>
If the first character is 'a', the query will return 0 or otherwise the string 'no'.<br/>
<br/>
By using a combination of the IIF, MID, LAST and TOP functions, it is possible to extract the first character of the username on a specifically selected row. As the inner query returns a set of records, and not just one, it is not possible to use it directly. Fortunately, we can combine multiple functions to extract a specific string.<br/>
<br/>
Let's assume that we want to retrieve the username of the 10th row. First, we can use the TOP function to select the first ten rows using the following query:<br/>
&nbsp;SELECT TOP 10 username FROM users<br/>
<br/>
Then, using this subset, we can extract the last row by using the LAST function. Once we have only one row and exactly the row containing our string, we can use the IIF, MID and LAST functions to infer the actual value of the username. In our example, we employ IIF to return a number or a string. Using this trick, we can distinguish whether we have a true response or not, by observing application error responses. As id is numeric, the comparison with a string results in a SQL error that can be potentially leaked by 500 Internal Server Error pages. Otherwise, a standard 200 OK page will be likely returned.<br/>
<br/>
For example, we can have the following query:<br/>
http://www.example.com/index.php?id='%20AND%201=0%20OR%20'a'=IIF((select%20MID(LAST(username),1,1)%20from%20(select%20TOP%2010%20username%20from%20users))='a','a','b')%00<br/>
that is TRUE if the first character is 'a' or false otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
As mentioned, this method allows to infer the value of arbitrary strings within the database:<br/>
By trying all printable values, until we find a match<br/>
By inferring the length of the string using the LEN function, or by simply stopping after we have found all characters<br/>
<br/>
Time-based blind SQL injections are also possible by abusing <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/it-it/library/cc512676%28en-us%29.aspx">heavy queries.</a></body></html>
