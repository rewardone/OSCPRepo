<title>Enum Attributes</title>
</head><body>In order to enumerate the column of a database table, it is possible to use a common error-based technique. In short, we can obtain the attributes name by analyzing error messages and repeating the query with different selectors. For example, assuming that we know the existence of a column, we can also obtain the name of the remaining attributes with the following query:<br/>
<br/>
' GROUP BY Id%00<br/>
<br/>
In the error message received, it is possible to observe the name of the next column. At this point, we can iterate the method until we obtain the name of all attributes. If we don't know the name of the first attribute, we can still insert a fictitious column name and obtain the name of the first attribute within the error message.</body></html>
