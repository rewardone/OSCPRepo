<title>Mitigation</title>
</head><body>Ideally, scripts should be written in which user input is properly validated and sanitized. At the minimum &lt; &gt; and &amp; “ should be considered dangerous characters. The best solution for sanitization is whitelisting instead of blacklisting. A list of allowed, rather than denied, characters should be checked.<br/>
<br/>
Defending Against the Attack<br/>
Solutions for Users<br/>
The only clear-cut solution for the user is to disable all scripting languages on their computer. Unfortunately, it is highly likely that much functionality of the sites regularly visited will be removed. Thus users should only pursue this option if they require the lowest possible level of request. Alternatively, users must be selective as to the sites they trust, and the sources of URL links. Again, the disabling of scripting languages will not prevent attackers influencing the appearance of content provided by trusted sites by embedding other HTML tags in the URL link. <br/>
With scripting enabled, visual inspection of links does not protect users from following malicious links, since the attacker’s web site may still use scripted code to alter the representation of the links in the client browser. <br/>
Unfortunately many integrated applications increase the threat of scripting code being executed on the users system, particularly through the use of embedded objects such as Flash! .swf files. To prevent these types of attacks, users must either uninstall the interpreters or ensure protection systems are capable of stopping the execution of such content. It is envisaged that popular anti-virus and personal intrusion detection systems will eventually be capable of this. <br/>
Frankly, the onus for protecting users against code insertion and CSS type attacks relies upon the development of secure server-side applications. Ideally, the application should correctly handle and comment submitted data. Unfortunately, the likelihood that the application developer will miss some subtle character representation is quite high.<br/>
<br/>
Solutions for Developers and Organisations<br/>
As no two applications are ever the same, application developers will need to tune their security countermeasures as defined by business requirements. The key to preventing applications being vulnerable to code injection and CSS type attacks is by ensuring that dynamically generated page content does not contain undesired HTML tags.<br/>
<br/>
The most likely sources of malicious data are likely to be:<br/>
<br/>
Query strings<br/>
URL’s and pieces of UL’s<br/>
Posted data<br/>
Cookies<br/>
Persistent data supplied by users, and retrieved at a later date (such as from databases)<br/>
The following methods or design considerations can be implemented by developers to better secure their application against HTTP based attacks, not just CSS.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Limit Server Responses</b><br/>
In many cases it may be possible to limit the amount of “personalised” data that will be returned to client browsers through the use of generic responses. <br/>
For example, consider a site that that displays the greeting “Hello, Gunter!” in response to http://trusted.org/greeting.jsp?name=Gunter. It would be a preferable security option to sacrifice this dynamic response with a hard-coded response such as “Hello, User!”<br/>
<br/>
<b>Enforce Response Lengths</b><br/>
For the majority of applications, the developer should be able to limit the maximum length of any user-supplied strings. Although initially enforced at the client-side, all strings should also be checked at the server-side. Where possible, enforce the limitation of the maximum necessary string length by truncating any longer responses.<br/>
<br/>
<b>HTTP Referer</b><br/>
As part of the HTTP standard, provision is made for a field header called “referer”. When a client browser follows a link or submits form data, the referer field should contain the URL of the page that the link or data came from. If possible, the web application should check the referer field and reject data if it didn’t come from the correct host or link.<br/>
<br/>
HTTP Referer<br/>
Usually appearing in the HEAD of any HTTP requests: <br/>
Referer: http://www.anonymous.com/Search <br/>
Accept-Language: en-gb <br/>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded <br/>
Host: www.anonymous.com<br/>
Advantages:<br/>
An attack would fail irrespective of any character or HTML tag filtering policies.<br/>
Disadvantages:<br/>
There is a risk of blocking legitimate links and form submission. As the referer field is optional, rejecting a blank referer field would prevent the application supporting certain client browsers.<br/>
In some cases, the referer field may be blank or missing if the user followed a link that may be referenced locally (e.g. email messages, cached pages and favourites).<br/>
Some browsers deliberately clear the referer field when navigating from a secure (HTTPS) page to an unsecure (HTTP) page.<br/>
Embedded Files and Objects<br/>
As witnessed by the Flash! Attack, attackers may be capable of embedding scripting components that can be interpreted by the client web browser and used to conduct a CSS attack. <br/>
For inclusion within a HTML based document, embedded files and objects are referred to using the HTML &lt;EMBED&gt; and &lt;OBJECT&gt; tags. Several options are available for decreasing the threat of embedded CSS attacks:<br/>
<br/>
The safest option is to treat &lt;EMBED&gt; and &lt;OBJECT&gt; tags the same as &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tags, and disallow any content to be submitted to the application that contains such data strings.<br/>
Depending upon the format of the embedded object, it may be possible parse filter content based upon content within the object. For instance, with Flash! files, it would be possible to remove all instances where the getURL() field contains a reference to a site other than the current application host. Alternatively, it may be possible to specify the target window as “_blank” and thus stopping any potential scripting code from being executed under the hosting domains privileges.<br/>
HTTP POST not GET<br/>
In the majority of cases, remote code insertion attacks are likely to be through the submission of user data in HTML forms. One prevention step is to ensure that form submission is only ever done through HTTP POST requests. Allowing HTTP GET request submissions will allow potentially attackers to craft distributable URL’s containing the offending code. <br/>
When coding the server-side application, it is extremely important to ensure that the client-side data can only be received through HTTP POST variables. Most web hosting applications will indicate the variable delivery method.<br/>
<br/>
<b>HTTP POST not GET</b><br/>
Forcing the use of HTTP POST over GET is a simple process and easy to implement.<br/>
Advantages:<br/>
Almost always removes the threat of URL based code insertion attacks.<br/>
Disadvantages:<br/>
Application users may not be able to save URLs to their favourites for quick access to the application component.<br/>
Cookie Inspection<br/>
Many applications utilise cookies for managing the state of the communication, and local storage of information relevant to the user. Application developers must ensure that all cookie information is thoroughly checked and filtered before insertion into the HTML documents. Attackers modifying persistent cookies can also make their attacks persistent.<br/>
<br/>
<b>URL Session Identifier</b><br/>
In some circumstances, the use of a unique session identifier for each valid user can be used to prevent remote exploitation of URL based code insertion attacks. <br/>
As a user arrives at the web site, they are automatically allocated a unique session ID. This session ID can ONLY be obtained from one page on the site (usually the start/home page). Should a visitor try to access any other page within the site without a valid session ID, they are automatically redirected to the start page and issued one. <br/>
Should an attacker discover a CSS flaw with one application component, any crafted exploit URL will have to contain a valid session ID. By rigorously controlling the session ID timeout, the attacker will not be able make use of the flaw (other than affecting the attacker locally) outside of this period. <br/>
For additional security, the session ID could also be made in include a hashed version (or checksum) of the client browser’s IP address.<br/>
<br/>
URL Session Identifier<br/>
URL session identifiers are often visible as: <br/>
http://trusted.org/app.jsp?session=h3uf8309ai9.830988<br/>
Advantages:<br/>
Likely to stop all long term insertion attacks.<br/>
With the addition of IP address information, session ID’s implemented this way will stop all URL based code insertion attacks.<br/>
.<br/>
<br/>
Disadvantages:<br/>
It is likely that the session ID will be allocated, and used, over HTTP. This session ID will thus be sent in the clear and will display in most logging systems (e.g. firewalls, proxies etc.). Developers must ensure that a different session ID is allocated and used during secure transactions.<br/>
This security measure can still be defeated by man-in-the-middle type attacks.<br/>
Character Sets<br/>
The success of code injection attacks relies heavily on the use of non a-Z characters. Some small measure of security can be gained by ensuring that an appropriate data is filtered using an appropriate character set.<br/>
<br/>
Character Sets<br/>
A popular character set is ISO 8859-1, which was the default in early versions of HTML and HTTP. <br/>
Ensure all content pages include the following: <br/>
&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"&gt;<br/>
Advantages:<br/>
Character submission in limited by the client web browser itself.<br/>
Can potentially reduce the amount of client-side code required to check user-supplied text. Thus it may also reduce the total size of the HTML content – making for faster download times.<br/>
Disadvantages:<br/>
Can be easily bypassed.<br/>
Will have an effect on character localisation issues.<br/>
Dangerous Content<br/>
Certain characters are of special significance when inserted into web pages or URL content. These characters are based upon the HTML specifications, context and browser interpretation. If input to the application (or web site) is not correctly validated, the following problems may occur:<br/>
<br/>
Session information from client cookies may be set and read,<br/>
User input could be intercepted,<br/>
Data integrity can be compromised,<br/>
Foreign scripting components can be executed by the client browser in the context of the trusted source.<br/>
Character&#09;Significance<br/>
&lt;&#09;The less-than character introduces a HTML tag.<br/>
&gt;&#09;The greater-than character is sometimes interpreted by client browsers as the end of a HTML tag, and assumes that the author of the page omitted an opening &lt; in error.<br/>
“&#09;The double quote character is often interpreted as the end of an attribute character.<br/>
%&#09;The percentage character is frequently used for encoding characters, such as their Unicode representation<br/>
&amp;&#09;The ampersand introduces a character entity. It is possible to combine the double quote and ampersand characters (“&amp; “ extravalue”) to combine character entities within a HTML tag. Within a URL, the &amp; introduces a character entity. Also, often used by UNIX based operating systems for command execution.<br/>
'&#09;HTML tag attribute values can be enclosed within single quotes.<br/>
SPACE&#09;Although most good developers prefer to quote attribute values, it is possible to omit these entirely as long as white-space characters are introduced. The SPACE character can be used as white-space. When used within URL information, the SPACE character is interpreted as the end of a URL.<br/>
TAB&#09;Following the same white-space principals as the SPACE character, TAB may also be used. When used within URL information, the TAB character is interpreted as the end of a URL.<br/>
; | !&#09;Semicolons, Pipes and exclamation characters for additional command execution - The dash (or minus sign) can be used in database queries, and the creation of negative numbers.<br/>
/ \&#09;The forward-slash and back-slash are often used for faking paths and queries.<br/>
( ) { } [ ]&#09;Brackets, curly brackets and square brackets are often used as script, program or regex expressions.<br/>
*&#09;Often used in database queries for “all”<br/>
? $ @ :&#09;Question mark, Dollar, At and Colon characters are often used as script or programming markers.<br/>
Hex Version&#09;The hex value of a character may be used, often done for non-printable characters. Such as: <br/>
x00 Null bytes for truncating strings <br/>
x04 EOF for faking the end of files <br/>
x08 Backspace x0a New Line for extra command execution <br/>
x0d New Line for extra command execution <br/>
x1b Escape character for breaking out of procedures <br/>
x20 Spaces for faking URLs and other names <br/>
x7f Delete<br/>
Non-ASCII&#09;Within a URL, non-ASCII characters (characters values above 128 in the ISO8859-1 encoding) are not allowed.<br/>
&nbsp;&#09; <br/>
When dealing with potentially dangerous user supplied data, organisation may approach from three different angles:<br/>
<br/>
Encode output based upon input parameters.<br/>
Filter input parameters for special characters.<br/>
Filter output based upon input parameters for special characters.<br/>
Applying the appropriate solution efficiently is dependant upon the language used to code the server-side application.<br/>
<br/>
Depending upon the application, and the particular phase of operation, it may be necessary to use different techniques to handle the special characters. In most instances input or output filtering will be sufficient. However, if particular client data submissions are likely to contain special characters (e.g. a complex database search query), it may be necessary to encode the resultant data for presentation back to the client.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Encode output based upon input parameters</b><br/>
In this method, any non-validated user data is always encoded to the appropriate HTML characters as it is written back to the user. For instance the character “&lt;“ would be encoded as “&amp;lt” and, although appearing to the user as the less-than character, would not be interpreted by the client application as the start of a HTML tag.<br/>
<br/>
If a web page uses the UFT-7 character encoding, there are several different strings which will act as a ‘&lt;’ character and start an HTML tag; all of these strings start with a ‘+’. It is also important that the use of the”%” encoding character be carefully monitored, as it can be used to escape-encode or Unicode special characters that will be correctly interpreted the client web browser. There are many methods of encoding text and special characters. A detailed analysis can be found in the earlier paper, “URL Encoded Attacks”.<br/>
<br/>
Encode output based upon input parameters<br/>
Microsoft Active Server Pages<br/>
&lt;% <br/>
var BaseURL = http://www.mysite.com/search2.asp?searchagain=;Response.write<br/>
("&lt;a href=\"" + BaseUrl + Server.URLEncode(Request.QueryString("SearchString")) + <br/>
"\"&gt;click-me&lt;/a&gt;"); <br/>
%&gt; <br/>
&lt;% Response.Write("Hello visitor &lt;I&gt;" + <br/>
Server.HTMLEncode(Request.Form("UserName")) + <br/>
"&lt;/I&gt;"); %&gt;<br/>
<br/>
With Microsoft’s ASP, the HTMLEncode call will automatically prevent any script in it from being executed.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Filter input parameters for special characters.</b><br/>
Input filtering works by removing some or all special characters from user supplied data as it reaches the server-side application components. Although it is possible to implement client-side input filtering, this should never be relied upon as it is often a trivial exercise for an attacker to bypass it. Even if implemented at the client-side, the server-side processes should carry out the same input filtering processes.<br/>
<br/>
The recommended method of implementing input filtering is to only select from the set of characters that is known to be safe rather than excluding the named special characters. This method is referred to as Positive filtering, and by only selecting the characters that are acceptable, it will help to reduce the ability to exploit other yet unknown vulnerabilities.<br/>
<br/>
For example, a form field that is expecting a person's age can be limited to the set of digits 0 through 9. There is no reason for this age element to accept any letters or other special characters.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Filter output based upon input parameters for special characters</b><br/>
Output filtering functions similarly to Input filtering, except that special characters are filtered from the data at the server-side application before being sent to the client web browser. This technique should be used when data is retrieved from databases or storage formats, particularly when there is a probability that non-filtered content could have been added by other applications or system processes.<br/>
<br/>
Special care should be taken when using Output filtering. If the application outputs HTML content, vigilance is required to ensure that special character filtering is restricted to data that has been previously supplied by a user and stored in a database. Filtering the special characters “&lt;“ and “&gt;“ too early in the process is likely to render the client HTML document useless.<br/>

<b>use PHP-IDS</b><br/>
<b>For sanitizing HTML, use HTMLPurifier/Antisamy, or use templating systems</b>!<br/>
If you have build/maintain an IDS/WAF, set up a demo site where the filters can be tested and bypasses submitted, please...<br/>
Don't trust your IDS, it can and will be bypassed!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do NOT simply escape the list of example characters provided in the various rules. It is NOT sufficient to escape only that list. Blacklist approaches are quite fragile. The whitelist rules here have been carefully designed to provide protection even against future vulnerabilities introduced by browser changes.<br/>
