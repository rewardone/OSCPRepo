<title>Open Redirects</title>
</head><body>Interesting topic<br/>
<br/>
Three things that enable the attack:<ul><li>An open redirect. Available at <a href="http://sw-redirect-to-xss.appspot.com/cgi-bin/redirect?url=http://evilwebsite.com">/cgi-bin/redirect?continue=</a>.</li>
<li>A Cache Service Worker. Available at <a href="http://sw-redirect-to-xss.appspot.com/sw.js">/sw.js</a>.</li>
<li>A page that embeds images via &lt;img crossorigin="anonymous" src="" /&gt;.</li>
</ul>
And the attacker's site has one thing:<br/>
A CORS enabled attack page. Available at <a href="http://other-origin-dot-sw-redirect-to-xss.appspot.com/cgi-bin/attack">/cgi-bin/attack</a>.<br/>
<br/>
When you click submit above the following things will happen:<ul><li>A service worker will be installed for the whole origin.</li>
<li>An image tag pointing to the open redirect will be created.</li>
<li>The service worker will cache the request with the CORS response of the attacker.</li>
</ul>
If all went well, the page above should be "poisoned", and forever (or until the SW updates it's cache) you will get the XSS payload.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
The summary is:<br/>
<ul><li>jQuery Mobile checks if you have anything in location.hash.</li>
<li>If your location.hash looks like a URL, it will try to set history.pushState on it, then it will do an XMLHttpRequest to it.</li>
<li>Then it will just innerHTML the response.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
As a strange saving grace, actually, the fact that it tries to call history.pushState first, makes the attack a little bit harder to accomplish, since you can't set history.pushState to cross-origin URLs, so in theory this should be safe.<br/>
<br/>
But it isn't, because if you have any open redirect you suddenly are vulnerable to XSS. Since the open redirect would be same origin as far as history.pushState is concerned.<br/>
<br/>
So.. you want to see a demo, I'm sure. Here we go:<br/>

The code is <a href="https://gist.github.com/sirdarckcat/ca04e67ea28500fe40bd498e7e3df0df">here</a>&nbsp;(super simple).</body></html>
