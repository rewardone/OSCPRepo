<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>CORS (cross-origin resource sharing) is actually a policy that loosens a security control called the Same-Origin Policy, or SOP for short. Therefore, in order to understand CORS, we must first understand the SOP.<br/>
<br/>
The most common way to implement a CORS policy is to check the origin request header against a whitelist or pattern-match (e.g. regex) first, then include the access-control-allow-origin only if the origin header met the whitelisting criteria. &nbsp;If we don’t include access-control-allow-origin in the response, it’s not an allowed origin, and the Same-Origin Policy will keep the JavaScript in the requesting application from being able to access the response.<br/>
<br/>
It’s worth noting that the wildcard access-control-allow-origin:* is sometimes used to allow general public access. This is much less concerning than a reflected origin, because access-control-allow-credentials: true will not be enforced with the wildcard origin. In other words, credentials are never allowed with a wildcard origin.<br/>
<br/>

CORS for hackers<br/>
Websites enable CORS by sending the following HTTP response header:<br/>
<br/>
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com<br/>
<br/>
This permits the listed origin (domain) to make visitors’ web browsers issue cross-domain requests to the server and read the responses - something the Same Origin Policy would normally prevent. By default this request will be issued without cookies or other credentials, so it can’t be used to steal sensitive user-specific information like CSRF tokens. The server can enable credential transmission using the following header:<br/>
<br/>
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true<br/>
<br/>
This creates a trust relationship - an XSS vulnerability on example.com is bad news for this site.</body></html>
