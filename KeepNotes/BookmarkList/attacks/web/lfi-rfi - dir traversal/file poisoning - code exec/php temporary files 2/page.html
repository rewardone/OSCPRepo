<title>PHP temporary files</title>
</head><body>Typically WINDOWS only<br/>
<br/>
This method is far less known and not really usable on platforms other than Windows. It is possible to send a file with arbitrary code to any PHP script, and include the temporary file that the PHP engine has created.<br/>
<br/>
if 'file_uploads = on' is set in the PHP configuration file, then PHP will accept a file upload post to any PHP file<br/>
<br/>
<b>Pros and cons</b><br/>
Good news is that it's common for a PHP script to have access to the directory (see upload_tmp_dir in php.ini) where the temporary files are created (i.e. can include files from this directory). On the default PHP installation the upload_tmp_dir is not set - in this case either /tmp on Linux-based systems or C:\Windows\Temp on Windows are used.<br/>
<br/>
The bad news is that the name of the temporary file is random, which renders this method unusable in most cases - it is fully exploitable on Windows and exploitable in some cases on other systems. <br/>
<br/>
On Windows<br/>
Only the lower 16 bits of the uUnique parameter are used. This limits GetTempFileName to a maximum of 65,535 unique file names if the lpPathName and lpPrefixStringparameters remain the same.<br/>
Only 65k unique names makes a brute force possible, and using current system time (number of milliseconds) makes things even simpler.<br/>
<br/>
On GNU/Linux<br/>
This function, depending on the way glibc is compiled, uses either (in pseudocode; variables are uint64_t):<br/>
1. random_value = (seed += time() ^ PID)<br/>
2. random_value = (seed += (gettimeofday().sec &lt;&lt; 32 | gettimeofday().usec) ^ PID)<br/>
3. random_value = (seed += rdtsc ^ PID)<br/>
The random_value is later written as 6 digits of k=62 (A-Za-z0-9 charset) numeric system, and appended to the "/tmp/php" prefix (unless another directory is set), e.g. /tmp/phpUs7MxA. From the aforementioned random_value generation methods, the 3rd is most commonly used nowadays. According to initial tests I made, the random value is unpredictable enough to be considered safe against remote attacker.<br/>
<br/>
<b>FindFirstFile 'quirk'</b>&nbsp;<br/>
Allows using masks (&lt;&lt; as * and &gt; as ?) in LFI paths on Windows. Thanks to this, one can form an include path like this:<br/>
<br/>
http://site/vuln.php?inc=c:\windows\temp\php&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Commonly there are other files with "php" prefix in this directory, so narrowing the mask might be required. In this case it's best to choose the widest possible mask that does not include any file (e.g. php1&lt;&lt; or phpA&lt;&lt;, in worse case php11&lt;&lt;, etc) and send upload-packets until the PHP engine will create a temporary file that will match the mask.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Assumptions needed for Linux exploitation</b><br/>
exploitation path is possible only in these specific cases:<br/>
When the tester is able to list the files in the upload (/tmp) directory (presumably by another PHP script) - this would require a race condition method where the tester uploads one file to a slow script (i.e. a script that runs for a relatively long time) and lists the files in the upload directory in another script, acquires the file temporary file name, and fires the LFI exploit.<br/>
<br/>
When the tester is able to list the $_FILES array in a script - this requires an even more tight race condition and is not always possible, since the attacker must obtain the $_FILES array content during upload and send another packet before the previous script ends and the temporary file is removed. This is not possible in case of buffering of PHP output (e.g. if mod_gzip is enabled in Apache).<br/>
