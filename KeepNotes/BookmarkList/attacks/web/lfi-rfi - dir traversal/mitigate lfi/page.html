</head><body>How to protect from LFIs?<br/>
Well, first, activate magic quotes, it’s not the “perfect solution”, but it’ll help. <br/>
Then you should also activate open_basedir to only read into your web folder and /tmp.<br/>
You should also do a function that parse the “/” , “.” and “%00” char.<br/>
But well, the best option is the non dynamic include:<br/>
<br/>
if ($_GET[‘page’] == “news”) {include(“news.php”);} else {include (“accueil.php”);}</body></html>
