<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>Local file inclusion means unauthorized access to files on the system. This vulnerability lets the attacker gain access to sensitive files on the server, and it might also lead to gaining a shell.<br/>
<br/>
Remote file inclusion uses pretty much the same vector as local file inclusion.<br/>
A remote file inclusion vulnerability lets the attacker execute a script on the target-machine even though it is not even hosted on that machine.<br/>
RFI's are less common than LFI. Because in order to get them to work the developer must have edited the php.ini configuration file.<br/>
<br/>
Local File Includes should not be confused with weak fopen calls in which you can read any file in the file system. You can tell the difference bwteen the two when reading files. A weak fopen call will let you read the source code to server side documents, while include() tries to execute them. &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
How does it work?<br/>
The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user-input. LFI is particularly common in php-sites.<br/>
Here is an example of php-code vulnerable to LFI. As you can see we just pass in the url-parameter into the require-function without any sanitization. So the user can just add the path to any file.<br/>
$file = $_GET['page'];<br/>
require($file);<br/>
<br/>
In this example the user could just enter this string and retrieve the /etc/passwd file.<br/>
http://example.com/page=../../../../../../etc/passwd<br/>
<br/>
It’s important not to overlook the proc file system when one of these vulnerabilities are found during a penetration test.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Basic Local File Inclusion</b>:<br/>
<ul><li><b>including uploaded files</b>&nbsp;- straight forward method; this requires existence of an upload functionality in the tested website (e.g. photo upload, or document upload), access to upload functionality and storage of uploaded files in a place accessible by the PHP script</li>
<li><b>include data:// or php://input pseudo protocols</b>&nbsp;- these protocols must be enabled and accessible via include (allow_url_include set to on); also, php://filter pseudo protocol is usable in some cases</li>
<li><b>including logs</b>&nbsp;- this required PHP script to be able to access certain types of logs, e.g. httpd server error logs or access logs; also, size of these logs might make the attack harder (e.g. if error log has 2GB)</li>
<li><b>including /proc/self/environ</b>&nbsp;- this requires PHP to be run as CGI on a system that has the /proc pseudo-filesystem and PHP script is required to have access to the aforementioned pseudo-file</li>
<li><b>include session files</b>&nbsp;- this requires the attacker to be able to influence the value of any string in a session (to inject code, e.g. &lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;), the sessions must be stored in a serialized session file (as e.g. x|s:19:"&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;"; - this is the default setting for PHP) and the PHP script must be able to access the session file (usually names /tmp/sess_SESSIONID)</li>
<li><b>include other files created by PHP application</b>&nbsp;- this is very application and system specific, but it basically describes any other file that is created the websites functionality and the way it works, e.g. database files, cache files, application-level logs, etc</li>
<li><b>include temporary files</b>&nbsp;- One other option is to take advantage of the way PHP handles file uploads via HTTP. This method is far less known and not really usable on platforms other than Windows. It is possible to send a file with arbitrary code to any PHP script, and include the temporary file that the PHP engine has created.</li>
<li><b>include server files</b>&nbsp;- Including files in the same directory, Path Traversal, Including injected PHP code / poisoning</li>
<li><b>include cookie </b>- Cookies or cookie variables can be included in webpages sometimes.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
.<br/>
<b>Special cases</b><br/>
Sometimes, even if you can read the /etc/passwd, it is not an include. For example, when they’ll use readfile() in php, it’ll load the file, but php code won’t be executed. It’s a problem to execute php code, but it’ll give you an advantage on one point, you’ll can read configs file.<br/>
<br/>
index.php?page=./forum/config<br/>
<br/>
Then show the source of the page to have the code.<br/>
<br/>
Just a quick note, here is a list of vulnerable PHP functions that you should look out for in your web apps:<br/>
Local / Remote file inclusion bugs: see <a href="nbk:///b3869c62-805d-4d59-8425-8f1253d774f4">Reverse Shells &gt; PHP &gt; Code Exec Functions</a>&nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
<b>A Look Back at RFI</b><br/>
RFI's (Remote File Includes) are a dying breed of vulnerabilities. Changes to PHP in version 5 make them nearly obsolete unless PHP is configured to allow them. The Fopen URL line determines whether or not they work. Typically for file inclusion vulnerabilities to exist, we need to control the variable that include() or require() is utilizing.<br/>
