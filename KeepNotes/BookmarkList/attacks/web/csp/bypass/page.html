https://apapedulimu.click/clickjacking-on-google-myaccount-worth-7500/<br/>
I just adding illegal character on the origin parameter. I try to put URL Encode before the business.google.com. Become like this:<br/>
https://myaccount.google.com/u/0/brandaccounts/group/101656179839819660704/managers?originProduct=AC&amp;origin=https://%0d.business.google.com <br/>
And csp is bypassed! <br/>
<br/>
Likely, %0d (carriage return) broke the parser or some such and allowed it to pass. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Other tags that don't respect CSP</b><br/>
Note that in some deployments of CSP, the destination URLs for &lt;img&gt; tags may be restricted for non-security reasons; in these cases, the attacker is free to leverage several other tags, including &lt;meta http-equiv="Refresh" ...&gt; - honored anywhere in the document in all popular browsers, and not subject to policy controls.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Vulnerable Subdomains</b><br/>
Nice article regarding <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/hacking-fortnite/">hacking fortnite</a>. If a CSP allows any subdomain, eg: *.epicgames.com and a vulnerability is present in a subdomain, it can be leveraged across the domain! eg ut2004stats.epicgames.com -&gt; account.epicgames.com</body></html>
