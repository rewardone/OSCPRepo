&nbsp;<br/>
What’s really interesting about this account is that since it’s a valid local administrator account, it can be used to authenticate over the network to the DC (if the DsrmAdminLogonBehavior regkey is set to 2) . Furthermore, the attacker doesn’t need to know the actual password, all that’s required is the password hash. This means that once an attacker has the password hash for the DSRM account, it can be “passed” to the DC for valid admin access to the DC across the network using Pass-the-Hash. This was tested successfully in limited lab testing on a Windows Server 2008 R2 &amp; 2012 R2 Domain Controllers.<br/>
