<title>Brute SSH known_hosts</title>
</head><body>When you ssh to a remote server, your ssh client records the hostname, IP address and public key of the remote server in a flat file called “known_hosts“. The next time you start a ssh session, the ssh client compares the server information with the one saved in the “known_hosts” file. If they differ, an error message is displayed. <br/>
<br/>
If an attacker has access to your home directory, he will have access to the file which may contains hundreds of hosts on which you also have an access.<br/>
<br/>
OpenSSH introduced a countermeasure against this attack since the version 4.0. The ssh client is able to store the host information in a hash format.<br/>
<br/>
The hostname is not readable anymore. To achieve this result, a new configuration directive has been added in version 4.0 and above: “HashKnownHosts [Yes|No]“. <br/>
<br/>
Note that this feature is not enabled by default. Some Linux (or other UNIX flavors) enable it by default. Check your configuration. If you switch the hashing feature on, do not forget to hash your existing known_hosts file:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; $ ssh-keygen -H -f $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts<br/>
<br/>
By looking into the OpenSSH client source code (more precisely in “hostfile.c“), I found how hostnames are &nbsp;hashed. Here is an example:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; |1|U8gOHG/S5rH9uRH3cXgdUNF13F4=|cNimv6148Swl6QcwqBOjgRnHnKs=<br/>
<br/>
“|1|” is the HASH_MAGIC. <br/>
The first part between the separators “|” is the salt encoded in Base64. When a new host is added, the salt is generated randomly. <br/>
The second one is the hostname HMAC (“Hash-based Message Authentication Code“) generated via SHA1 using the decoded salt and then encoded in Base64. <br/>
<br/>
Once the hashing performed, it’s not possible to decode it. Like UNIX passwords, the only way to find back a hostname is to apply the same hash function and compare the results.<br/>
