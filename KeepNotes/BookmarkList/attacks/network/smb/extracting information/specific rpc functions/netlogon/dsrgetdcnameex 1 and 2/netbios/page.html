</head><body>I connected to the DC01.labs.com system (192.168.57.2) and issued the DsrGetDcNameEx2 command, requesting DC01.labs.com to find a domain controller for the domain name BLACK (192.168.57.120), with has a user called Administrator.<br/>
<br/>
In the trace below, we can see the packets sent directly after the DsrGetDcNameEx2 command is executed<br/>
<br/>
The DC01.labs.com system first sends out a NBNS name query broadcast, trying to find any domain controller &lt;1C&gt; for the domain name BLACK.<br/>
<br/>
At #148 we see the BLACK domain controller respond to the NBNS query broadcast, telling the DC01.labs.com its IP address. In #150, the DC01 system starts to process the response, and sends out ARP requests to connect the BLACK domain controller.<br/>
<br/>
In #149 the DC01.labs.com system broadcasts a UDP SMB_NETLOGON packet, and then later in #153 specifically sends the same packet to the BLACK domain controller, using its IP address.<br/>
<br/>
When the BLACK domain controller processes the SMB_NETLOGON packet, it tries in #152 to establish the IP address of DC01 via a NBNS lookup, and gets a NBNS response in #153.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, in #155, the BLACK domain controller sends its response to the SMB_NETLOGON packet.<br/>
<br/>
From this trace, we can see that we can cause both the system that we execute the DsrGetDcNameEx2 function on, and the domain controller that responds to the SMB_NETLOGON request, to do NBNS lookup requests. We also control the names that both systems will lookup via NBNS, and can respond to those requests with any IP address. This effectively allows one, without providing any authentication, to instruct a Window domain controller to connect to any provided IP address via NetBIOS. I wondered if this could be used to obtain hashes using something like Responder, however as all packets resulting from theDsrGetDcNameEx2 are UDP based, and no SMB TCP connections are established, it doesn’t seem to be trivial. I’m still playing around with Responder to see what one could do with this, but at the very least one seem to be able to use this approach to proactively poison a system’s cache with a NETBIOS name and a corresponding IP.<br/>
<br/>
With regards to enumerating users, let’s look at the SMB_NETLOGON packet. While Wireshark classifies this packet as SMB_NETLOGON, it is in fact a mailslot write packet, as discussed by MSDN in https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc223816.aspx,https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc234511.aspx , https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee442092.aspx and https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc223804.aspx.<br/>
<br/>
The structure of the packet is quite involved, and includes various fields. In Wireshark a request such as the one sent in #153<br/>
<br/>
The majority of this packet is simply preamble, working its way towards the request which Wireshark puts under the section “Microsoft Windows Logon Protocol (Old)”, and MSDN calls the NETLOGON_SAM_LOGON_REQUEST structure in the Databytes field. The exception to this is the requested domain name, in this case BLACK, which is sent in the start of this packet.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the NETLOGON_SAM_LOGON_REQUEST structure we can see three fields of interest, i.e. UnicodeComputerName, UnicodeUserName and AllowableAccountControlBits.<br/>
<br/>
The AllowableAccountControlBits value is the same as before, i.e. 0x00000010 as was used in the construction of the CLDAP packet. The Computer Name field contains the NetBIOS host name of the system from which the request originated. It is this value that the domain controller will lookup using NBNS requests, as previously discussed. This isn’t ideal, as this requires an implementation of NBNS response packets to obtain the mailslot ping response. One can avoid this behaviour, by simply setting the value to an IP address. The MSDN documents state that both the Computer Name and User Name fields should be encoded in UTF-16.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at the response provided for this packet, we see a near identical structure, with the exception of the Databytes field<br/>
<br/>
Wireshark somewhat confusingly interprets the response code incorrectly as “user unknown”. As mentioned before, MSDN states that the response code 23, or 0x17 in hex is reserved for “LOGON_SAM_LOGON_RESPONSE_EX”. Response code 25, or 0x19 is however reserved for “LOGON_SAM_USER_UNKNOWN_EX”.<br/>
<br/>
When sending a mailslot ping request with a username that doesn’t exist, the server does reply with the 25 response code, however Wireshark fails to interpret the response structure<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, we can thus establish if a user exists by sending a mailslot ping packet, and checking if the response code is 23 or 25.<br/>
<br/>
Crafting these packets is somewhat complicated, so I looked at scapy for some help. I had to make some changes to the existing scapy structures, and also had to implement the NETLOGON_SAM_LOGON_REQUEST structure. In addition, both the username and source hostname needed to be encoded with UTF-16. Another thing to take into account, as highlighted in the above captures, was the length and size fields that change with different usernames and hostnames. MSDN and RFC 1001 and RFC 1002 helpfully state the required calculations needed for these fields. Putting this altogether I was able to create a script that can enumerate users using this method, which you can get over here.<br/>
