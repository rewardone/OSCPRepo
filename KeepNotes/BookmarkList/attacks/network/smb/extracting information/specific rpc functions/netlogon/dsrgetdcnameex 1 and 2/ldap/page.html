<title>LDAP</title>
</head><body>Let’s first look at the DNS and LDAP, approach. Since we are not actually interested in finding a domain controller using the method, we will skip the DNS part, and focus only on the LDAP packet.<br/>
<br/>
Specifically, the method sends a LDAP search query to the remote system. This is often referred to as a CLDAP packet, or connectionless LDAP packets, as it uses UDP instead of TCP. Beyond this, there is little difference between the structure of a CLDAP packet and a normal LDAP search packet, as they both use ASN.1.<br/>
<br/>
The CLDAP packet requests the LDAP server to search for an object that matches various filters. These include:<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp;&#09;<ul><li>the provided domain name (BLACK.COM)</li>
<li>the requested username (Administrator)</li>
<li>the name of the host that requested the search, in both NetBIOS and DNS form (DC01.LABS.com)</li>
<li>The GUID of the sought domain, which can be left blank.</li>
<li>The NETLOGON_NT_VERSION, which can be used to configure the reply of the server as detailed at <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc223801.aspx">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc223801.aspx</a>.</li>
<li>the AAC or AllowableAccountControl, bits. This value is mapped from the AAC value provided by the DsrGetDcNameEx2 request, according to the table at <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc245737.aspx/">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc245737.aspx/</a>. One can get the values at <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc245514.aspx">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc245514.aspx</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc245515.aspx">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc245515.aspx</a>. For a normal account, i.e. UF_NORMAL_ACCOUNT (512), the value is changed to USER_NORMAL_ACCOUNT(16) which has a hex value of 0x00000010.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
The request also specifies that only the Netlogon attribute of the object be returned.<br/>
<br/>
In the above case, the user Administrator exists on the BLACK.COM domain, and thus the server replies.<br/>
<br/>
The operation code is perhaps the most important value, as it indicates if the search returned a result or not. As detailed at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc223803.aspx,the number 23 indicates that the server responded with a valid LOGON_SAM_LOGON_RESPONSE_EX structure, which contains information about the domain controller. This indicates that the user existed in the specified domain.<br/>
<br/>
When the same packet is sent, but for a user that doesn’t exists, we get an operation code of 25 and the LOGON_SAM_USER_UNKNOWN_EX structure<br/>
<br/>
We can thus send such a packet to a remote domain controller, and determine if a user exists by checking if it responds with an operation code of 23 or of 25.<br/>
<br/>
To do so, we need to however be able to craft a CLDAP packet. The Samba source code includes an example perl script which can create such a CLDAP packet, located at <a href="https://github.com/samba-team/samba/blob/master/examples/misc/cldap.pl">https://github.com/samba-team/samba/blob/master/examples/misc/cldap.pl</a>.</body></html>
