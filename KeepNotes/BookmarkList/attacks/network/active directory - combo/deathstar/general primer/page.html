</head><body>Clone Empire, install it, then run the following:<br/>
<br/>
python empire --rest --username username --password password<br/>
<br/>
That will start Empire's console and RESTful API server.<br/>
<br/>
To get DeathStar up and running:<br/>
<br/>
git clone https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/DeathStar<br/>
# Death Star is written in Python 3<br/>
pip3 install -r requirements.txt<br/>
# Supply the username and password you started Empire's RESTful API with<br/>
./DeathStar.py -u username -p password<br/>
<br/>
If all goes well Death Star will create a http listener and you should see a 'Polling for Agents' status: this means you're authenticated to Empire's RESTful API and DeathStar is waiting for that first Agent.<br/>
<br/>
All you need now is an Agent on a domain joined machine, how you do that is beyond the scope of this blog post. I'd recommend using CrackMapExec but I'm biased.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Conclusion</b><br/>
DeathStar demonstrates that automating obtaining Domain Admin rights in an Active Directory environment is a clear possibility using existing open-source toolsets. I expect to see many more tools that do something like this in the near future (I personally know two people who are working on their own versions/implementations which is awesome, and I encourage more people to do so)<br/>
<br/>
One final point I'd like everyone to reflect on: I put this together in 3-4 days. Imagine what a bunch of much more smarter people than me could do/have already done with more time and resources (cough cough nation states cough cough). That's something that I think is particularly interesting.</body></html>
