<title>ASLR</title>
</head><body>Linux kernel 2.6.8 by default doesn't have ASRL (ASLR got added into the Linux kernel by default from 2.6.12 onwards), therefore the attacker doesn't have to worry about ASLR on older kernels (typically)<br/>
<br/>
In linux, ASLR is typically set in proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space with value of 1. You can turn it off if you have permissions:<br/>
# echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space<br/>
<br/>
You can set /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space with a value of 2 to force it on for everything. <br/>
# echo 2 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space<br/>
<br/>
value meanings:<br/>
0: ASLR disabled<br/>
1: ASLR (stack, virtual dynamic shared object page, and shared memory regions)<br/>
2: ASLR (1 + shared data segments as well)<br/>
<br/>
You can also use ldd to help identify if ASLR is active<br/>
# ldd &lt;binary&gt; | grep libc<br/>
If the address that is returned changes with each invocation of ldd, then ASLR is enabeld</body></html>
