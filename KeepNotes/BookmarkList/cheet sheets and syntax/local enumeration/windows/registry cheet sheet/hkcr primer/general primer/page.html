</head><body>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT is just a combination of HKLM:\Software\Classes and HKCU:\Software\Classes<br/>
Due to the fact that these are merged, you can "hijack" keys in HKCR:\CLSID by adding keys in HKCU:\Software\Classes\CLSID. <br/>
<br/>
A lot of things (such as scheduled tasks) pull from HKCR:\CLSID for actions<br/>
COM objects will load from HKCR:\CLSID. </body></html>
