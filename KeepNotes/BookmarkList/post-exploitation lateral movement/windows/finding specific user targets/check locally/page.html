<title>Check Locally</title>
</head><body>Always check the initially compromised system first. There’s really no point is running around the network looking for Domain Admin processes if you already have one. Below is a simple way to check if any Domain Admin processes are running using native commands:<br/>
<ul><li>Run the following command to get a list of domain admins: net group “Domain Admins” /domain</li>
<li>Run the following command to list processes and process owners. The account running the process should be in the 7th column. Tasklist /v</li>
<li>Cross reference the task list with the Domain Admin list to see if you have a winner.</li>
</ul>
