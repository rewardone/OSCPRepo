<title>General Primer</title>
</head><body>Eventually it occurred to us to simply query the domain controllers for a list of active domain user sessions and cross reference it with the Domain Admin list. The only catch is you have to query all of the domain controllers. Below I’ve provided the basic steps to get list of systems with active Domain Admin sessions as a domain user:<br/>
<br/>
<b>1. </b>Gather a list of Domain Controllers from the “Domain Controllers” OU using LDAP queries or net commands. I’ve provided a net command example below:<br/>
net group “Domain Controllers” /domain<br/>
<br/>
<b>Important Note</b>: The OU is the best source of truth for a list of domain controllers, but keep in mind that you should really go through the process of enumerating trusted domains and targeting those domain controllers as well.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, you can look them up via DNS:<br/>
Nslookup –type=SRV _ldap._tcp.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2.</b>&nbsp;Gather a list of Domain Admins from the “Domain Admins” group using LDAP queries or net commands. I’ve provided a net command example below:<br/>
net group “Domain Admins” /domain<br/>
<br/>
<b>3.</b>&nbsp;Gather a list of all of the active domain sessions by querying each of the domain controllers using Netsess.exe. Netsess is a great tool from Joe Richards that wraps around the native Windows function “netsessionenum”. It will return the IP Address of the active session, the domain account, the session start time, and the idle time. Below is a command example:<br/>
Netsess.exe –h<br/>
<br/>
<b>4.</b>&nbsp;Cross reference the Domain Admin list with the active session list to determine which IP addresses have active domain tokens on them. In more secure environments you may have to wait for a Domain Admin or Service account with Domain Admin privileges to take actions on the network. What that really means I you’ll have to run through the process multiple time, or script it out. Below is a very quick and dirty Windows command line script that uses netsess. Keep in mind that dcs.txt has a list of domain controllers and admins.txt has a list of Domain Admins:<br/>
FOR /F %i in (dcs.txt) do @echo [+] Querying DC %i &amp;&amp; @netsess -h %i 2&gt;nul &gt; sessions.txt &amp;&amp; <br/>
FOR /F %a in (admins.txt) DO @type sessions.txt | @findstr /I %a<br/>
<br/>
I wrote a basic batch script named <a href="https://github.com/nullbind/Other-Projects/tree/master/GDA">Get Domain Admins (GDA)</a>&nbsp;which can be download &nbsp;that automates the whole process. The dependencies are listed in the readme file. I would like to give a shout out to Mark Beard and Ivan Dasilva for helping me out on it. I’ve also created a batch file called Get Domain Users (GDU) for Windows Dictionary attacks which has similar options, but more dependencies.
