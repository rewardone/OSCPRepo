<title>Invoke-EnumerateLocalAdmins</title>
</head><body>If you are not in a constrained scenario, very large enterprise network, or worried about making a little noise, the Invoke-EnumerateLocalAdmins –OutFile &lt;file.csv&gt; function can be very helpful. This function will perform a Get-NetLocalGroup against every system in the domain and output the results in CSV format. With this, and some enrichment data from the domain (user hunt data, user/group info), you could paint a picture of how to get from one system to another using entirely derivative local admin abuse.</body></html>
