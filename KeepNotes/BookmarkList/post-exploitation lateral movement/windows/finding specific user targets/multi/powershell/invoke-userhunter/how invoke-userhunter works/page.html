<title>How Invoke-UserHunter Works</title>
</head><body>Below the hood, the user hunting functions in PowerView are relatively straight forward and worth a read. <br/>
For Invoke-UserHunter, the script will first query the members of the target group (“Domain Admins” by default).<br/>
Next, the script will query the domain for all machines using Get-NetComputers. <br/>
Finally, the script will perform a Get-NetSessions and Get-NetLoggedOn against every host in the list and look for the users previously queried. <br/>
<br/>
While this technique provides the most coverage, it has the possibility of being slow and noisy-ish depending on the network (though we rarely get caught with it).<br/>
<br/>
*If you want the raw dump of where all of the users are logged in, you can add a -ShowAll flag to the user hunter scripts. I prefer this so we do not have to query multiple times!</body></html>
