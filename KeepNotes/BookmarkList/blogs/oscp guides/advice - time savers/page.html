<title>Advice / Time Savers</title>
</head><body>Advice:<ul><li>Script as much as possible in a re-usable way (ie flexile modules)</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none"><ul><li>Page of “quick scripts” that I could copy and paste into a terminal, such as a wget <b>powershell script</b>, <b>ftp download script</b>, etc… These were all from techniques I used in the labs.</li>
<li>Attempt to automate as much as possible, but still understand how everything really works</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure you understand every exploit you use, if it’s a Metasploit module, ensure that you can port it to a standalone version.</li>
<li>Make sure you have a windows environment to compile binaries, cross compiling sometimes gave me a lot of headaches which were quickly solved by using Windows with Visual Studio and codeblocks.</li>
<li>Lesson learned: Have a process, know your process, stick to your process.</li>
<li>Check firewall/IPTable rules (or remove them)</li>
<li>tmux or split terminal windows, reduce the need and complexity of terminal tabs</li>
<li>For the love of God, please take good notes from the beginning. My note taking was atrocious, by the time the exam rolled around I had to go back and re-root 10 unique machines from scratch because my notes were so bad, all so I could document my steps to get an extra 5 bonus points. This is the last thing you need to be doing before an exam attempt.</li>
<li>Time management: Schedule early and pull an all nighter? OR schedule later at night and work, sleep, last few hours work refreshed</li>
<li>Read Exam Instructions carefully word by word don’t miss any single word, else it will surely mess up.</li>
<li>Define Max amount of time you will work on each machine, once time is up, move on to next box.</li>
<li>Do not Update any tools before exam, it will mess up the stability, I updated one of the tool and had to spend 20 minutes on it, but was able to get rid of it.</li>
<li>Take backups frequently, who knows VM may crash due to something…..</li>
<li>Take as much screenshots as you can, step by step, Don’t forget to get important screenshot due to excitement, Its natural we get more excited when we get r00tw00t, and later on you realize about missing screenshots, name it appropriately, which will save your time while working on report.</li>
<li>I would say, Attend all, struggle till last moment, don’t loose patience, at some point you may feel, you have enough points to pass exam, but trust me it can be an illusion, so always set goal to attend all!..</li>
<li>Even if you are unable to get complete access, document your steps, it may help you.</li>
<li>Enumeration is the key!…if you are unable to get direction loop it back to Enumeration step.</li>
<li>If you are unsure where to go next, LISTEN! Maybe something else interesting is happening on the wire. Maybe logs show connections to other places!</li>
</ul>

Ping an admin on the IRC about 5-10 minutes before the exam starts. Start a private message chat and let them know you have an exam starting soon. Ask if you can PM them again if you have any questions once you receive and read the exam packet.</body></html>
