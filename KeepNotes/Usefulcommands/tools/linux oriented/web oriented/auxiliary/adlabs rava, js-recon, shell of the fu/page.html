</head><body><b>Ravan</b><br/>
Ravan is a JavaScript Distributed Computing system that uses HTML5 WebWorkers to perform brute force attacks on salted hashes in background JavaScript threads across a farm of workers.<br/>
<br/>
Salted and plain versions of the following hashing algorithms are currently supported:<br/>
<br/>
MD5<br/>
SHA1<br/>
SHA256<br/>
SHA512<br/>

<b>JS-Recon</b><br/>
JS-Recon a HTML5 based JavaScript Network Reconnaissance tool. It uses HTML5 features like CrossOriginRequests and WebSockets to perform network and port scanning from the browser.<br/>
<br/>
Current functionality:<br/>
<br/>
Port Scanning<br/>
Network Scanning<br/>
Detecting Internal IP Address<br/>

<b>Shell of the Future</b><br/>
Shell of the Future is a Reverse Web Shell handler. It can be used to hijack sessions where JavaScript can be injected using Cross-site Scripting or through the browser's address bar. It makes use of HTML5's Cross Origin Requests and can bypass anti-session hijacking measures like Http-Only cookies and IP address-Session ID binding.<br/>
<br/>
It can be used to:<br/>
<br/>
Demonstrate the severity of XSS and JavaScript injection attacks<br/>
Create POCs for XSS vulnerabilities in Penetration test reports<br/>
Run automated scans on internal websites from outside by tunneling the traffc through an internal browser<br/>

<b>DSer</b><br/>
This is a plugin template for Burp Proxy that is used for penetration testing of JAVA Serialzied Objects passed in POST data. It was part of the demo presented at BlackHat Europe 2010.<br/>
<br/>
The plug-in provides the following:<br/>
<br/>
Deserialized the JAVA Object from the captured POST data<br/>
Injects a (J)IRB shell within Burp Proxy<br/>
Provides helper methods to access private varialbles and other useful stuff<br/>

<b>Imposter</b><br/>
Imposter is a flexible framework to perform Browser Phishing attacks.<br/>
<br/>
The lists of attacks performed are:<br/>
<br/>
Steal cookies<br/>
Set cookies<br/>
Steal Local Shared Objects<br/>
Steal stored passwords from FireFox<br/>
Steal cached files<br/>
Poison browser cache<br/>
Steal files from the victim's local file system through Internet Explorer<br/>
Run SQL queries on the victim's Google Gears database and transfer the results<br/>
Create ResourceStore and Managed ResourceStore on the victim's Google Gears LocalServer<br/>

<b>Sniff-n-Spit</b><br/>
During Penetration testing it can be seen that thick-clients sometimes communicate with a server whose IP address is hardcoded in to it. The HTTP communication between such client and server is harder to intercept and test. Sniff-n-Snip is a very useful utility in such scenarios. It sniffs for HTTP packets from the client to server and forwards them to your favorite proxy (Burp, WebScarab , Paros etc).<br/>
