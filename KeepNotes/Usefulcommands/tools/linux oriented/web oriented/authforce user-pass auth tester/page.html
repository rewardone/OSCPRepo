<title>AuthForce: User/Pass Auth Tester</title>
</head><body><a href="http://www.divineinvasion.net/authforce">http://www.divineinvasion.net/authforce</a>&nbsp;<br/>
Hydra probably better? <br/>
<br/>
Description<br/>
Authforce is an HTTP authentication brute forcer. Using various methods, it attempts brute force username and password pairs for a site. It has the ability to try common username and passwords, username derivations, and common username/password pairs. It is used to both test the security of your site and to prove the insecurity of HTTP authentication based on the fact that users just don’t pick good passwords.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
History<br/>
I made this because I was curious how bad people were at choosing decent passwords. It can also be used to test the security of your site.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Usage<br/>
See the README. You run it, it searches and displays matches.<br/>
