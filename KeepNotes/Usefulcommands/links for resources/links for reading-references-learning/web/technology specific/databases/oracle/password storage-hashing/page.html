<title>Password Storage/Hashing</title>
</head><body>Oracle has never published what algorithm is used to generate their password hashes, but it appears that no salt is used seeing as Oracle hash lists are published revealing hashes and their associated passwords.<br/>
The account allows us full access to the database, including the ability to stop, start, and even modify the database!<br/>
<br/>
Oct. 15, 2005 – Two researchers (Jashua Wright and Carlos Cid) identified weaknesses in the Oracle hashing mechanism for protecting the passwords <br/>
Weak SALT (uses username for SALT)<br/>
Lack of case preservation (Oracle passwords are case insensitive; “PASSWORD” is the same as “password”) associated passwords.<br/>
Weak algorithm<br/>
<br/>
Oracle Password Algorithm (7-10g Rel.2)<br/>
&nbsp;Up to 30 characters long. All characters will be converted to uppercase before the hashing starts<br/>
&nbsp;8-byte hash, encrypted with a DES encryption algorithm without real salt (just the username).<br/>
&nbsp;The algorithm can be found in the book "Special Ops Host And Network Security For Microsoft, Unix, And Oracle“<br/>
&nbsp;Oracle database 11g offers the (optional) possibility to use passwords up to 50 characters (uppercase/lowercase).<br/>
&nbsp;In Oracle 11g the passwords are now hashed with DES (column: password) AND using SHA-1 (column: spare4). The SHA-1 passwords are now supporting mixed-case passwords. In 11g the<br/>
password hashes are no longer available in dba_users.<br/>
– Oracle (7-10g R2) encrypts the concatenation of (username||password) --- sys/temp1 and system/p1 have the identical hashkey (2E1168309B5B9B7A)<br/>
– Oracle (11g R1) uses SHA-1 to hash the concatenation of (password||salt)</body></html>
