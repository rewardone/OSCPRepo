<title>More stupid blocking tricks
</title>
</head><body>Note: Although these redirect techniques are aimed at blocking and redirecting nasty scum-sucking sites, the directives may also be employed for friendly redirection purposes:<br/>
<br/>
# redirect any request for anything from spamsite to differentspamsite<br/>
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} ^http://.*spamsite.*$ [NC]<br/>
RewriteRule .* http://www.differentspamsite.com [R]<br/>
<br/>
# redirect all requests from spamsite to an image of something at differentspamsite<br/>
RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} ^http://.*spamsite.*$ [NC]<br/>
RewriteRule .* http://www.differentspamsite/something.jpg [R]<br/>
<br/>
# redirect traffic from a certain address or range of addresses to another site<br/>
RewriteCond %{REMOTE_ADDR} 192.168.10.*<br/>
RewriteRule .* http://www.differentspamsite.com/index.html [R]<br/>
