<title>Deny/allow multiple IP addresses on one line
</title>
</head><body>Save a little space by blocking multiple IP addresses or ranges on one line. Here are few examples (edit values to suit your needs):<br/>
<br/>
# block two unique IP addresses<br/>
Deny from 99.88.77.66 11.22.33.44<br/>
<br/>
# block three ranges of IP addresses<br/>
Deny from 99.88 99.88.77 11.22.33<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, to allow multiple IP addresses or ranges on one line:<br/>
<br/>
# allow two unique IP addresses<br/>
Allow from 99.88.77.66 11.22.33.44<br/>
<br/>
# allow three ranges of IP addresses<br/>
Allow from 99.88 99.88.77 11.22.33</body></html>
