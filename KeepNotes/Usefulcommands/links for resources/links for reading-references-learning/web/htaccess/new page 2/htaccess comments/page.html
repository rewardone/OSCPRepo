<title>.htaccess comments</title>
</head><body>It is an excellent idea to consistenly and logically comment your .htaccess files. Any line in an .htaccess file that begins with the pound sign ( # ) tells the server to ignore it. Multiple lines require multiple pounds and use letters/numbers/dash/underscore only:<br/>
<br/>
# this is a comment<br/>
# each line must have its own pound sign<br/>
# use only alphanumeric characters along with dashes - and underscores _<br/>
<br/>
