<title>Redirect from “www” domain to “non-www” domain
</title>
</head><body>This technique is referred to as www canonicalization. It uses a “301 redirect” to establish a permanent redirect from the “www” version of a domain to its corresponding “non-www” version. Be sure to test immediately after preparing 301 redirects and remove it immediately if any errors occur. Use a server header checker to confirm a proper 301 response. Further, always include a trailing slash / when linking directories. Finally, be consistent with the www subdomain in all links (either use it always or never).<br/>
<br/>
# permanently redirect from www domain to non-www domain<br/>
RewriteEngine on<br/>
Options +FollowSymLinks<br/>
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.domain\.tld$ [NC]<br/>
RewriteRule (.*) http://domain.tld/$1 [R=301,L]<br/>
This code redirects all requests for any URL at www.domain.tld to their respective URLs at domain.tld (i.e., it removes the www prefix from all requests). For more information on www-canonicalization, check out Canonical www via .htaccess and Canonical URLs for a single page site.</body></html>
