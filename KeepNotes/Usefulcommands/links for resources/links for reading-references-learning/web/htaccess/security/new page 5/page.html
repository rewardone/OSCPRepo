<title>Change the default index page
</title>
</head><body>This rule tells the server to search for and serve business.html as the default directory index. This rule must exist in the .htaccess files of the root directory for which you wish to replace the default index file (e.g., index.html):<br/>
<br/>
# serve alternate default index page<br/>
DirectoryIndex business.html<br/>
<br/>
This rule is similar, only in this case, the server will scan the root directory for the listed files and serve the first match it encounters. The list is read from left to right:<br/>
<br/>
# serve first available alternate default index page from series<br/>
DirectoryIndex filename.html index.cgi index.pl default.htm<br/>
