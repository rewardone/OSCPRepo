<title>.htaccess comments</title>
</head><body>Comments are essential to maintaining control over any involved portion of code. Comments in .htaccess code are fashioned on a per-line basis, with each line of comments beginning with a pound sign #. Thus, comments spanning multiple lines in the .htaccess file require multiple pound signs.<br/>
<br/>
Further, due to the extremely volatile nature of .htaccess voodoo, it is wise to include only alphanumeric characters (and perhaps a few dashes and underscores) in any .htaccess comments. For more information, check out my tutorial commenting your .htaccess code.</body></html>
