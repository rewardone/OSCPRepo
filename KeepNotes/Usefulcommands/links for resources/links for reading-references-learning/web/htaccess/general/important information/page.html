<title>Important Information</title>
</head><body>As a configuration file, .htaccess is very powerful. Even the slightest syntax error (like a missing space) can result in severe server malfunction. Thus it is crucial to make backup copies of everything related to your site (including any original .htaccess files) before working with your Hypertext Access file(s). It is also important to check your entire website thoroughly after making any changes to your .htaccess file. If any errors or other problems are encountered, employ your backups immediately to restore original functionality.<br/>

Also note that, on most machines, .htaccess files are hidden by default. For more information, check out my tutorial, <a href="https://wp-mix.com/create-htaccess-files-osx-windows/">Create .htaccess files on OS X and Windows.</a></body></html>
