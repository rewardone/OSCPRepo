<title>Performance Issues</title>
</head><body>.htaccess directives provide directory-level configuration without requiring access to Apache’s main server cofiguration file (httpd.conf). However, due to performance and security concerns, the main configuration file should always be used for server directives whenever possible.<br/>
<br/>
For example, when a server is configured to process .htaccess directives, Apache must search every directory within the domain and load any and all .htaccess files upon every document request. This results in increased page processing time and thus decreases performance. Such a performance hit may be unnoticeable for sites with light traffic, but becomes a more serious issue for more popular websites.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, .htaccess files should only be used when the main server configuration file is inaccessible. See the Performance Tricks section of this article for more information.</body></html>
