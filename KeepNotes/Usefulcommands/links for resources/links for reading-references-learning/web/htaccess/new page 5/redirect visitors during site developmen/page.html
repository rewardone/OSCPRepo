<title>Redirect visitors during site development
</title>
</head><body>During web development, maintenance, or repair, send your visitors to an alternate site while retaining full access for yourself. This is a very useful technique for preventing visitor confusion or dismay during those awkward, web-development moments. Here are the generalized .htaccess rules to do it (edit values to suit your needs):<br/>
<br/>
# redirect all visitors to alternate site but retain full access for you<br/>
ErrorDocument 403 http://www.alternate-site.com<br/>
Order deny,allow<br/>
Deny from all<br/>
Allow from 99.88.77.66<br/>
