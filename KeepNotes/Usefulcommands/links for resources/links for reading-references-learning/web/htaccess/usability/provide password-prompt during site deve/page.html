<title>Provide password-prompt during site development
</title>
</head><body>Here is another possible solution for “hiding” your site during those private, site-under-construction moments. Here we are instructing Apache to provide visitors with a password prompt while providing open access to any specifically indicated IP addresses or URLs. Edit the following code according to your IP address and other development requirements (thanks to Caleb at askapache.com for sharing this trick):<br/>
<br/>
# password prompt for visitors<br/>
AuthType basic<br/>
AuthName "This site is currently under construction"<br/>
AuthUserFile /home/path/.htpasswd<br/>
AuthGroupFile /dev/null<br/>
Require valid-user<br/>
# allow webmaster and any others open access<br/>
Order Deny,Allow<br/>
Deny from all<br/>
Allow from 111.222.33.4<br/>
Allow from favorite.validation/services/<br/>
Allow from googlebot.com<br/>
Satisfy Any<br/>
