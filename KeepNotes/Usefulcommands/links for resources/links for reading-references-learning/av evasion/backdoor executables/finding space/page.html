<title>Finding Space</title>
</head><body>Two approaches:<br/>
<br/>
1) <b>Adding a New Section</b><br/>
<br/>
This one has more drawbacks with detection score compared to the other approach but with appending a whole new section there is no space limit for the backdoor code that will be implanted.<br/>
<br/>
With using a dis assembler or PE editor like LordPE, all PE files can be enlarged with adding a new section header, here is the section table of putty executable, with the help of PE editor, new section “NewSec” added with the size of 1000 bytes,<br/>
<br/>
While creating a new section, <b>setting the section flags &nbsp;as “Read/Write/Execute” &nbsp;is vital</b>&nbsp;for running the backdoor shellcode when PE image mapped on the memory.<br/>
<br/>
After adding the section header the file size needs to be adjusted, this can be easily achieved with adding null bytes with the size of the section at the end of the file on a hex editor.<br/>
<br/>
After these operations new empty section is successfully added to the file, running the file after adding a new section is suggested in case of any errors, if the executable is running smoothly the new section is ready to be modified on a debugger.<br/>
<br/>
Solving the space problem with adding a new section has few drawbacks on anti detection score, almost all AV products recognizes uncommon sections and giving all (Read/Write/Execute) permission to an uncommon section is surely very suspicious.<br/>
<br/>
Even when adding a empty full permission section to putty executable, it gets flagged as malicious by some AV products.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>2) Code Caves<br/>
</b><br/>
Second approach for solving the space problem is using the code caves of the target executable. Almost all compiled binary files have code caves that can be used when backdooring operations. Using code caves instead of new added sections attracts far less AV product because of using already existing common sections. Also overall size of the PE file will not changed at the end of backdooring process but this method also has few drawbacks.<br/>
<br/>
The number and size of the code caves varies file to file but generally there is not so much space compared to adding a new section. When using code caves, backdoor code should be trimmed as much as possible. Another drawback is the section flags. Since the execution of the application will be redirected to the cave, the section which contains the cave should have “execute” privileges, even some shellcodes (encoded or obfuscated in a self modifying way) needs also “write” privileges in order to make changes inside the section.<br/>
<br/>
Usage of multiple code caves will help overcoming the space limitation problem also splitting the backdoor code to pieces will have a positive affect on detection score but unfortunately changing the section privileges will look suspicious. There are few advanced methods that modifies the memory region privileges on runtime in order to avoid changing the section privileges directly, but because of those methods requires custom crafted shellcodes, encodes and IAT parsing techniques, it will be next articles subject.<br/>
<br/>
With the help of a tool called Cminer it is very easy to enumerate all code caves of a binary file, ./Cminer putty.exe 300 command enumerates the code caves witch is bigger than 300 bytes,<br/>
<br/>
In this case there are 5 good code caves that can be used. Start address gives the virtual memory address (VMA) of the cave. This is the address of the cave when PE file loaded into memory, file offset is the location address of cave inside the PE file in terms of bytes.<br/>
<br/>
It seems most of the caves are inside data sections, because of data sections doesn’t have execute privileges section flags, needs to be changed. Backdoor code will be around 400-500 bytes so cave 5 should be more than enough. The start address of selected cave should be saved, after changing the section privileges to R/W/E the first step of backdooring process will be completed. Now it’s time to redirecting the execution.<br/>
