<title>Password Types</title>
</head><body>Windows 'Credential Store' supports different type of network passwords. Each type uses different kind of encryption and storage mechanism. Also each type of password requires different level of access privileges for decryption. <br/>
<br/>
Here are the primary types....<br/>
Generic Password<br/>
Domain Password<br/>
Domain Visible Password / .NET Passport<br/>
Certificates<br/>
<br/>
'Domain Password' type provides highest level of security as these passwords can only be managed by a specific system process called LSASS.exe. No other process, even though it is running as administrator can decrypt such passwords. All network authenticaiton, Remote Desktop and Outlook exchange server login passwords belongs to this type. <br/>
<br/>
'Generic Password' type is used to store all user specific credentials and only that user can decrypt such passwords. Internet Explorer (basic &amp; digest authentication) and Windows Live Messenger uses this method to store their login credentials. <br/>
<br/>
'Domain Visible Password' is similar to 'Generic Password' mechanism. However in case of 'Generic Password' both username &amp; password are encrypted and for 'Domain Visible Password' only password is encrypted. Also both types use different salt as entropy for decryption of the password. MSN messenger 7.0 uses this method to store the login passwords with the name as '.Net Passport'</body></html>
