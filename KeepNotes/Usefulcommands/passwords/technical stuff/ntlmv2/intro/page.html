</head><body>Unlike the previous two protocols, NTLMv2 was not released with a major OS but with the release of a service pack – Windows NT 4 SP4 [Melber 2004]. While not a complete overhaul, NTLMv2 resolved many security deficiencies of its predecessors through the use of longer passwords, longer keys for the hash, and mutual authentication [Melber 2004]. Additionally, the security of the challenge response mechanism was also enhanced [CIAC 2008]. &nbsp;<br/>

NTLMv2 improves upon LM and NTLM hashes and their weaknesses. It uses the NT hash; however, it also includes a client challenge in the computation. NTLMv2 also includes timestamps which makes it immune to reply attacks (Minsai, 2008), and is the default authentication method used from Windows Vista onward. &nbsp;</body></html>
