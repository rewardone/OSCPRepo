<title>Creation</title>
</head><body>The process to create the LM hash is relatively complex. When a user creates a new password, this password is converted to all uppercase, then it's padded out to 14 characters. The password is then split into two 7-byte chunks. The two chunks then will be used as a key in a Data Encryption Standard (DES) encryption to encrypt a fixed value. The values of the two DES operations are concatenated and the result is stored as the LM hash (Johansson, 2009). <br/>
<br/>
This process shows that the LM hash has two substantial weaknesses. First, the password length is limited to 14 characters, broken up into two independent 7-byte chunks. Second, the password is case-insensitive which decreases the key space available for the users to choose their passwords from (Lam, LeBlanc, &amp; Smith, 2004). &nbsp;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, if a password is used that consists of 14 or less characters, both the LM and NT hash will be created and stored in the local Security Accounts Manager (SAM) file or in Active Directory (AD) [Microsoft 2007]. To make matters worse, neither of these one way functions incorporates a degree of randomization (called a salt) into the process [Johansson 2005]. So, if two NT hashes are identical then the odds are extremely high that the passwords they’re based on are also identical (the topic of hash collisions are outside the scope of this paper). Also, the NT hash is derived by taking the cleartext password and converting it to Unicode, and then hashing that value with the MD4 algorithm</body></html>
