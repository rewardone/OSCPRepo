<title>Delivery Person</title>
</head><body>The impersonation of a delivery person can be a powerful weapon in a criminal’s arsenal because not much acting is required. Usually, the most difficult thing about impersonation is looking the part and having the necessary credentials, papers, and “deliveries” in order.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Uniform Impersonation</b>&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
Impersonating a USPS mail carrier is a perfect attack vector for a criminal to take since trust is already built into the uniform. &nbsp;A USPS mail carrier can typically walk in and out of buildings with few restrictions. At times they are even allowed into secure areas to deliver packages with little or no questions asked.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Non-Uniform Impersonation</b>&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
The flower or pizza delivery person will not necessarily have a standard uniform, making impersonation easy to perpetrate in a social engineering attack. In larger cities, bicycle messengers or couriers are a common service. Often these messengers will be allowed right into a building. While the receptionist is busy confirming the order/delivery; the attacker might be left alone with access to a computer to plant a malicious USB key.<br/>

<b>How Can You Protect Your Organization?</b>&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
With education and training these attacks can be avoided. One of the best ways to protect your organization is to know who your regular delivery person is. Typically, it will be the same person for a given area. If it is not your regular delivery person, ask for credentials. For USPS employees, they must carry identification with them. Keep in mind though, that with proper planning, an attacker can even fake an identification card.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to prevent this attack from happening is to not allow a delivery person past the front desk unattended. If a delivery person must enter your building, make sure they are escorted and do not leave them unattended. This will mitigate the chances they have for an attack. If you are still unsure if a person is who they say they are, call the company they work for. The company will be able to tell you if they are in fact an employee.<br/>
