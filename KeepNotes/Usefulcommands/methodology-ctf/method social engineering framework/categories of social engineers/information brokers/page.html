<title>Information Brokers</title>

<b>How Information Brokers Use Social Engineering</b>&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
Information Brokers use elicitation, scams, courting, and pretexting to gather data about personal information. Information (Data) Brokers collect data and provide data mining services for various organizations such as the FBI, Credit Monitoring Services, and the DoD. These companies are a high value target for social engineers as they contain huge amounts of information that could be used to further elevate or support your SE activities. Because of relaxed regulations and federal laws much of our personal information is collected by government agencies, such as the DMV, and stored or managed by these Information Broker Companies, such as ChoicePoint.<br/>
<br/>
In the book Information Risk and Security: Preventing and Investigating Workplace Computer Crime, the author provides an example of Courting“Information brokers and other determined social engineers often use a technique known as courting. Seemingly random or chance meetings that build a rapport and a level of trust between the social engineer and the target. Over time a relationship is built and subtly pressure is applied and information gathered.”<br/>
<br/>
<b>Examples of Information Brokers Who Were Social Engineered</b>&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
ChoicePoint<br/>
Criminals were able to dupe ChoicePoint into supplying them information as legitimate customers. Social engineering was used to open fake phone numbers, business licenses, and street addresses to open accounts as legitimate businesses. Because of current loop holes in laws it is difficult to determine who is using data for legitimate purposes.<br/>
<br/>
DOCUSEARCH<br/>
Liam Youens obtained information about Amy Lynn Boyer from DOCUSEARCH. He contacted DOCUSEARCH on several occasions asking for information about her social-security number, telephone number and address. Each time a service provided by DOCUSEARCH was paid for and provided. DOCUSEARCH actually had some outdated information and placed a call to Boyer, through pretexting, to confirm information about her address. Unfortunately, Youens used this information to track down Boyer and fatally shot her at her place of work.<br/>
<br/>
Chris Swecker<br/>

Homeless Hacker – Adrian Lamo was able to penetrate the Times’ network and access a database containing the personal information of 3,000 individuals.
