<title>Scoping Meeting</title>
</head><body>Scoping Meeting<br/>
In many cases the scoping meeting will occur after the contract has been signed. Situations do occur wherein many of the scope-related topics can be discussed before contract signing, but they are few and far between. For those situations it is recommended that a non-disclosure agreement be signed before any in-depth scoping discussions occur.<br/>
<br/>
The goal of the scoping meeting is to discuss what will be tested. Rules of engagement and costs will not be covered in this meeting. Each of these subjects should be handled in meetings where each piece is the focus of that meeting. This is done because discussions can easily become confused and muddled if focus is not explicitly stated. It is important to act as moderator and keep the discussions on-topic, preventing tangents and declaring certain topics more suited for off-line discussion when necessary.<br/>

Now that a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) value has been established for the project it is time to have a meeting with the customer to validate assumptions. First, it needs to be established explicitly what IP ranges are in scope for the engagement. It is not uncommon for a client to be resistant and assume that it is the prerogative of the tester to identify their network and attack it, to make the test as realistic as possible. This would indeed be an ideal circumstance, however, possible legal ramifications must be considered above all else. Because of this, it is the responsibility of the tester to convey to a client these concerns and to impart upon them the importance of implicit scoping. For example, in the meeting, it should be verified that the customer owns all of the target environments including: the DNS server, the email server, the actual hardware their web servers run on and their firewall/IDS/IPS solution. There are a number of companies which will outsource the management of these devices to third parties.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, the countries, provinces, and states in which the target environments operate in must be identified. Laws vary from region to region and the testing may very well be impacted by these laws. For instance, countries belonging to the European Union are well known to have very stringent laws surrounding the privacy of individuals, which can significantly change the manner in which a social engineering engagement would be executed.</body></html>
