</head><body>Cloud Services<br/>
The single biggest issue with testing cloud service is there is data from multiple different organizations stored on one physical medium. Often the security between these different data domains is very lax. The cloud services provider needs to be alerted to the testing and needs to acknowledge that the test is occurring and grant the testing organization permission to test. Further, there needs to be a direct security contact within the cloud service provider that can be contacted in the event that a security vulnerability is discovered which may impact the other cloud customers. Some cloud providers have specific procedures for penetration testers to follow, and may require request forms, scheduling or explicit permission from them before testing can begin.</body></html>
