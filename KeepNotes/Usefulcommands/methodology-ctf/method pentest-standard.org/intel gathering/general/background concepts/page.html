Levels are an important concept for this document and for PTES as a whole. It’s a maturity model of sorts for pentesting. Defining levels allows us to clarify the expected output and activities within certain real-world constraints such as time, effort, access to information, etc.<br/>

The Intelligence Gathering levels are currently split into three categories, and a typical example is given for each one. These should guide the adding of techniques in the document below. For example, an intensive activity such as creating a facebook profile and analyzing the target’s social network is appropriate in more advanced cases, and should be labeled with the appropriate level. See the mindmap below for examples.</body></html>
