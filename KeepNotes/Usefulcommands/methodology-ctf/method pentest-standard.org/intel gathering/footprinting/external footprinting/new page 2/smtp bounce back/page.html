<title>SMTP Bounce Back</title>
</head><body>==== SMTP Bounce Back ====<br/>
SMTP bounce back, also called a Non-Delivery Report/Receipt (NDR), a (failed) Delivery Status Notification (DSN) message, a Non-Delivery Notification (NDN) or simply a bounce, is an automated electronic mail message from a mail system informing the sender of another message about a delivery problem. &nbsp;This can be used to assist an attacker in fingerprint the SMTP server as SMTP server information, including software and versions, may be included in a bounce message.<br/>
<br/>
This can be done by simply creating a bogus address within the target's domain. For instance, asDFADSF_garbage_address@target.com could be used to test target.com. Gmail provides full access to the headers, making it an easy choice for testers.</body></html>
