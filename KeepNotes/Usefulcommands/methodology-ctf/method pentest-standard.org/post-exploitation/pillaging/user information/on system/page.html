</head><body>==== On System ====<br/>
General information that can be gather on a compromised system are:<br/>
*History files - History files store recent commands the user has executed. Reading through these can reveal system configuration information, important applications, data locations and other system *sensitive information.<br/>
*Encryption Keys (SSH, PGP/GPG)<br/>
*Interesting Documents (.doc/x, .xls/x , password.*) - Users often store passwords and other sensitive information in clear text documents. These can be located in two ways, either searching through file names for interesting words, such as password.txt, or searching through the documents themselves. Indexing services can help with this, for example the Linux locate database.<br/>
*User specific application configuration parameters<br/>
*Individual Application History (MRU Windows only, history files..etc)<br/>
*Enumerate removable media<br/>
*Enumerate network shares / domain permission (gpresult)</body></html>
