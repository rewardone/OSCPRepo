<title>Certificate Authority</title>
</head><body>==== Certificate Authority ====<br/>
Identification of Certificate Authority services on a compromised client host will allow for the access to &nbsp;<br/>
*Root CA<br/>
*Code Signing Certificates<br/>
*Encryption and Signing Certificates<br/>
Control of the service will also allow for the <br/>
*Creation of new certificates for several tasks<br/>
*Revocation of certificates<br/>
*Modification of the Certificate Revocation List<br/>
*Insertion of Root CA Certificate<br/>
The control of the services shows risk and allows for the compromise of data and services on a client’s network and hosts.</body></html>
