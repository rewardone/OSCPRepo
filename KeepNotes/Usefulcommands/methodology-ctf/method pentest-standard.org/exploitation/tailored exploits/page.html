<br/>
In a number of occasions the exploits that are public on the Internet may need some work in order to successfully complete. In most cases, if an exploit is designed for Windows XP SP2, specific modifications to the exploit will be required in order for the attack to be successful via Windows XP &nbsp;SP3. The penetration tester should have the knowledge in place to be able to customize an exploit and the ability to change on the fly in order to successfully complete the attack.</body></html>
