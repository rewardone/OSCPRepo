<br/>
Consider that you used this command line to start a cracking job:<br/>
<br/>
hashcat -m 0 -a 3 --session session_name example0.hash masks/rockyou-7-2592000.hcmask<br/>
<br/>
and you hit 'c' (or 'q' for quit) while it was running (or it was stopped/killed for some other reasons).<br/>
<br/>
This command resumes the above cracking job:<br/>
<br/>
hashcat --session session_name --restore<br/>
<br/>
The --restore command does not need nor allow any further arguments except from --session (and --restore itself). You can't simply add or change some arguments when you restore the job. If you really insist to change any arguments, you might be able to use some external tools (like analyze_hc_restore) at your own risk.<br/>
<br/>
