Design:<br/>
<br/>
Use strong ciphers (AES 128 or better) with secure mode of operations (do not use ECB).<br/>
Use strong hashes (SHA 256 or better) with salts for passwords.<br/>
Protect keys more than any other asset.<br/>
Use TLS 1.2 or later for all web communications.<br/>
Buy extended validation (EV) certificates for public web servers.<br/>
<br/>
Tip: Use TLS 1.2 always – even internally. Most snooping is done within corporate networks – and it is as easy and unethical as fishing with dynamite.<br/>
