<title>Human Assets</title>
</head><body>=== Human Assets===<br/>
When identifying human assets in an organization, we have to remember that the context is having such assets part of a greater effort to compromise the organization. As such, human assets that are identified as business assets are those that could be leveraged to divulge information, manipulated to make decisions or actions that would adversely affect the organization or enable an attacker to further compromise it.<br/>
Human assets are not necessarily the highest up within the corporate hierarchy, but are more often key personnel that are related to previously identified business assets, or are in positions to enable access to such assets. This list can also include employees that normally would not be associated with access to restricted company assets, but may be in a position to grant physical access to a company that facilitates a breach of security or procedure.<br/>
The following list provides some examples of such assets, and should be adapted to the organization being tested.<br/>
* Executive Management<br/>
* Executive Assistants<br/>
* Middle Management<br/>
* Administrative Assistants<br/>
* Technical/Team Leads<br/>
* Engineers<br/>
* Technicians<br/>
