In the light of a PTES assessment the internally hosted CRM application may be in scope. The customer information stored in the back-end database is an easily identifiable primary asset as it is directly linked to the application in scope. However, by reviewing the technical design of the database server, it can also be identified that the HR database stored on the same back-end database server is a secondary asset. An attacker can use the CRM application as a stepping stone to obtain employee information. In a basic threat modeling exercise, certain threat communities may be identified as not relevant when mapped to the CRM application, but by identifying the secondary assets the threat landscape suddenly changes.</body></html>
