</head><body>=== Information assets supporting process ===<br/>
Contrary to technical infrastructure, information assets are existing knowledge bases in the organization that are used as either a reference, or as support material (decision making, legal, marketing, etc...). Such assets are usually identified in the business process already, and should be mapped alongside the technical infrastructure, as well as any additional technical infrastructure that supports the information assets themselves.</body></html>
