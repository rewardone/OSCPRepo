'''Metadata Analysis'''<br/>
<br/>
Metadata analysis involves looking at data that describes a file, as opposed to the file data itself. A Microsoft Office document for example, might list the document author, company, when the document was last saved, when the document was created, and so on. Many documents even allow for the entry of custom metadata. This could potentially contain internal addresses and paths to servers, internal IP addresses, and other information a penetration tester could use to gain additional access or information.<br/>
<br/>
Though metadata is quite common on documents located on a company’s internal network, companies should take care to purge metadata before making documents available to the public, or on the public Internet. For this reason, any metadata an attacker could gain access to passively (without directly attacking the target) should be considered a security issue.<br/>
<br/>
'''Traffic Monitoring'''<br/>
<br/>
Traffic monitoring is the concept of connecting to an internal network and capturing data for offline analysis. Route poisoning is excluded from this phase as these create “noise” on the network and can easily be detected. It is often surprising how much sensitive data can be gleaned from a “switched” network. This “leaking of data” onto a switched network can be categorized as follows:<br/>
<br/>
ARP/MAC cache overflow, causing switched packets to be broadcast - this is common on Cisco switches that have improper ARP/MAC cache timing configurations.<br/>
<br/>
Etherleak - some older network drivers and some embedded drivers will use data from system memory to pad ARP packets. If enough ARP packets can be collected, sensitive information from internal memory can be captured<br/>
<br/>
Misconfigured clusters or load balancers<br/>
<br/>
Hubs plugged into the network<br/>
Note that some of these categories only result in data leakage to a single subnet, while others can result in leakage to much larger network segments.</body></html>
