<br/>
'''Correlation between Tools'''<br/>
<br/>
When working with multiple tools the need for correlation of findings can become complicated. Correlation can be broken down into two distinct styles, specific and categorical correlation of items, both are useful based on the type of information, metrics and statistics you are trying to gather on a given target.<br/>
<br/>
Specific correlation relates to a specific definable issue such as vulnerability ID, CVE, OSVDB, vendor indexing numbers, known issue with a software product, etc. and can be grouped with micro factors such as hostname, IP, FQDN, MAC Address etc. An example of this would be grouping the findings for host x by CVE number as they would index the same issue in multiple tools.<br/>
<br/>
Categorical correlation relates to a categorical structure for issues such as in compliance frameworks (i.e. NIST SP 800-53, DoD 5300 Series, PCI, HIPPA, OWASP List, etc.) that allow you to group items by macro factors such as vulnerability types, configuration issues, etc. An example of this would be grouping all the findings for hosts with default passwords into a group for password complexity within NIST 800-53 (IA-5). <br/>
<br/>
In most cases penetration testers are going to focus on the micro issues of specific vulnerabilities found in redundancy between multiple tools on the same host. This redundancy can skew the statistical results in the test output leading to a false increased risk profile.<br/>
<br/>
The inverse of this is with an over reduction or simplification in macro correlation (i.e. top 10/20 lists) as the results can skew the output resulting in a false reduced risk profile.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
'''Manual Testing/Protocol Specific'''<br/>
<br/>
'''VPN'''<br/>
<br/>
''Fingerprinting''<br/>
<br/>
Fingerprinting is useful to determine the type of VPN device and correct version of code released installed. By accurately fingerprinting the device, proper research and analysis can then be conducted against the target system.<br/>
<br/>
''Authentication''<br/>
<br/>
VPN devices can operate with various forms of authentication. Using VPN toolkits that are not part of conventional vulnerability assessment tools allow for proper identification of the authentication mechanisms and determine weaknesses that may exist such as pre-shared keys or default group IDs.<br/>
<br/>
'''Citrix'''<br/>
<br/>
''Enumeration''<br/>
<br/>
Many default installations and poorly configured Citrix appliances provide a means to enumerate published applications and determine valid usernames that are configured to authenticate to the device. This information becomes crucial during brute force attacks and attempts to break out of predefined profiles for authorized users.<br/>
<br/>
'''DNS'''<br/>
<br/>
Domain Name Systems can offer an abundance of information to an attacker when they are not properly hardened. Version information allow for proper identification and accurate research analysis. Weaknesses such as zone transfers provide an exhaustive list of additional targets for attack as well as information leakage of potentially sensitive data pertaining to the target organization. <br/>
<br/>
'''Web'''<br/>
<br/>
Web services provide a large landscape for an attacker. Unlike most other protocols and services, web services are often found running on multiple ports of a single system. Administrators may focus their hardening on the common ports for web services or published directories and neglect to properly harden additional attributes. Web services should always be reviewed in a manual fashion as automated assessment tools are not capable of identifying most weaknesses in their services.<br/>
<br/>
'''Mail'''<br/>
<br/>
Mail servers can provide an abundance of information about a target organization. Using inherent functions in the target device, confirmation of valid accounts can be conducted as well as developing a list of potential usernames for additional attacks on other systems. Vulnerabilities such as mail relaying can be leveraged for additional attacks on the organization such as phishing. Often, mail servers will provide a web interface for remote access that can be targeted in brute force campaigns.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
'''Attack Avenues'''<br/>
<br/>
'''Creation of attack trees'''<br/>
<br/>
During a security assessment, it is crucial to the accuracy of the final report to develop an attack tree as testing progresses throughout the engagement. As new systems, services and potential vulnerabilities are identified; an attack tree should be developed and regularly updated. This is especially important during the exploitation phases of the engagement as one point of entry that materializes could be repeated across other vectors mapped out during the development of the attack tree. <br/>
<br/>
'''Isolated Lab Testing'''<br/>
<br/>
The accuracy of vulnerability analysis and exploitation is substantially greater when replicated environments are setup in an isolated lab. Often times, systems may be hardened with specific control sets or additional protection mechanisms. By designing a lab that mimics that of the target organization, the consultant can ensure that the vulnerabilities identified and exploits attempted against the desired targets are reliable and lessen the opportunity for inaccurate results or system inoperability.<br/>
<br/>
'''Visual Confirmation'''<br/>
<br/>
''Manual Connection with Review''<br/>
<br/>
While proper correlation can help reduce false findings and increase overall accuracy, there is no substitute for visually inspecting a target system. Assessment tools are designed to review the results of a protocol/service connection or the response and compare to known signatures of vulnerabilities. However, tools are not always accurate in identifying services on uncommon ports or custom logic that may be built into an application. By manually assessing a target system, its services available and the applications that provide functionality for those services, a tester can ensure that proper validation and vulnerability identification have been completed.</body></html>
