</head><body>== Example Avenues of Attack ==<br/>
<br/>
In any scenario, the attacks should consist based on the scenario that is within scope of the engagement. Below is a list of several attack avenues to consider based on scenario but is by no means a comprehensive list.<br/>
<br/>
Web Application Attacks<br/>
Social-Engineering<br/>
Physical Attack Avenues<br/>
Memory Based Exploits (i.e. buffer/heap overflows, memory corruptions, use-after-free).<br/>
Man in the Middle<br/>
VLAN Hopping<br/>
USB/Flash Drive deployment <br/>
Reverse Engineering<br/>
Zero-Day Angle<br/>
Attacking the user<br/>
Encryption Cracking<br/>
Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) Cracking<br/>
Traffic Analysis<br/>
Firewire<br/>
Routing protocols <br/>
Phishing with Pretexting<br/>
Employee Impersonation <br/>
<br/>
Again, these examples are only basic avenues for attack based on the scenario you are performing for the organization. The value from a penetration test comes from creativity and the ability to identify exposures and exploit them in a precise manner. </body></html>
