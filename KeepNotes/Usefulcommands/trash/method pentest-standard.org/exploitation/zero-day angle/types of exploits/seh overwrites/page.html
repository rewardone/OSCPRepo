<title>SEH Overwrites</title>
</head><body>==== SEH Overwrites ====<br/>
<br/>
SEH overwrites occur when the structured exception handler begins to gracefully close an application. The attacker can manipulate how SEH works, overwrite the base address of the SEH handler and gain control of execution flow through the SEH. This is a common attack leveraged with buffer overflow vulnerability and applications that have been complied with SEH. </body></html>
