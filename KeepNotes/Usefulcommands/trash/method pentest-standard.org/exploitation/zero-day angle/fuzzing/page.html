</head><body>=== Fuzzing ===<br/>
<br/>
Fuzzing is the ability to recreate a protocol or application and attempt to send data at the application in hopes of identification of a vulnerability. Often times the hopes of a fuzzer is to identify a crash in an application and craft a specific exploit out of it. In the case of fuzzing, the attacker is attempting to create a specific vulnerability out of something that hasn't been discovered before. As part of a penetration test, if no avenues are identified during the engagement, or the engagement calls for zero-day research; fuzzing techniques should be leveraged in order to identify potentially vulnerable exposures. &nbsp;</body></html>
