The main focus of a penetration test is to simulate an attacker in order to represent a simulated attack against the organization. The value brought through a penetration test is generally not through smash and grab techniques where the attacks are noisy in nature and in an attempt to try every exploit. This approach may be particularly useful at the end of a penetration test to gauge the level of incident response from the organization, but in most cases the exploitation phase is a accumulation of specific research on the target.</body></html>
