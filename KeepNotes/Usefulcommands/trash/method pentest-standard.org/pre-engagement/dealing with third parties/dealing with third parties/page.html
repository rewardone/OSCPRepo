</head><body>Dealing with Third Parties<br/>
There are a number of situations where an engagement will include testing a service or an application that is being hosted by a third party. This has become more prevalent in recent years as “cloud” services have become more popular. The most important thing to remember is that while permission may have been granted by the client, they do not speak for their third party providers. Thus, permission must be obtained from them as well in order to test the hosted systems. Failing to obtain the proper permissions brings with it, as always, the possibility of violating the law, which can cause endless headaches.</body></html>
