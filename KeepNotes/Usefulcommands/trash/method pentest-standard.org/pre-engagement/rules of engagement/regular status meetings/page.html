</head><body>Regular Status Meetings<br/>
Throughout the testing process it is critical to have regular meetings with the customer informing them of the overall progress of the test. These meetings should be held daily and should be as short as possible. Meetings should be kept to three concepts: plans, progress and problems.<br/>
<br/>
Plans are generally discussed so that testing is not conducted during a major unscheduled change or an outage. Progress is simply an update to the customer on what has been completed so far. Problems should also be discussed in this meeting, but in the interest of brevity, conversations concerning solutions should almost always be taken offline.</body></html>
