The aim of this section of the PTES is to present and explain the tools and techniques available which aid in a successful pre-engagement step of a penetration test. The information within this section is the result of the many years of combined experience of some of the most successful penetration testers in the world.<br/>
<br/>
If you are a customer looking for penetration test we strongly recommend going to the General Questions section of this document. It covers the major questions that should be answered before a test begins. Remember, a penetration test should not be confrontational. It should not be an activity to see if the tester can "hack" you. It should be about identifying the business risk associated with and attack.<br/>
<br/>
To get maximum value, make sure the questions in this document are covered. Further, as the Scoping activity progresses, a good testing firm will start to ask additional questions tailored to your organization.</body></html>
