*Email Address (L1)<br/>
**What it is? &nbsp;Email addresses are the public mail box ids of the users.<br/>
**Why you would do it? &nbsp;Email address harvesting or searching is important because it serves multiple purposes - provides a probable user-id format which can later be brute-forced for access but more importantly it helps sending targeted spams and even to automated bots. These spam emails can contain exploits, malware etc. and can be addressed with specific content particularly to a user.<br/>
**How you would do it? &nbsp;Email addresses can be searched and extracted from various websites, groups, blogs, forums, social networking portals etc. These email addresses are also available from various tech support websites. There are harvesting and spider tools to perform search for email addresses mapped to a certain domain (if needed).<br/>
