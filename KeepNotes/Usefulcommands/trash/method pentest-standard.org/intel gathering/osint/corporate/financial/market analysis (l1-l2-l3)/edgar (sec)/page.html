<title>EDGAR (SEC)</title>
</head><body>===== EDGAR (SEC) =====<br/>
*What is it: EDGAR (the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system) is a database of the U.S. Security and Exchanges Commission (SEC) that contains registration statements, periodic reports, and other information of all companies (both foreign and domestic) who are required by law to file.<br/>
*Why do it: EDGAR data is important because, in additional to financial information, it identifies key personnel within a company that may not be otherwise notable from a company’s website or other public presence. It also includes statements of executive compensation, names and addresses of major common stock owners, a summary of legal proceedings against the company, economic risk factors, and other potentially interesting data.<br/>
*How to obtain: The information is available on the SEC’s EDGAR website (http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml). Reports of particular interest include the 10-K (annual report) and 10-Q (quarterly report).</body></html>
