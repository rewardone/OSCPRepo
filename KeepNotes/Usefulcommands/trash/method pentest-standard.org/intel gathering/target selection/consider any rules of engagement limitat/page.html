<title>Consider any Rules of Engagement limitations</title>
</head><body>At this point it is a good idea to review the Rules of Engagement. It is common for these to get forgotten during a test. Sometimes, as testers we get so wrapped up in what we find and the possibilities for attack that we forget which IP addresses, domains and networks we can attack. Always, be referencing the Rulles of Engagement to keep your tests focused. This is not just important from a legel perspective, it is also important from a scope creep perspective. Every time you get sidetracked from the core objectives of the test it costs you time. And in the long run that can cost your company money.</body></html>
