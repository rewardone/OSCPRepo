<title>Listening Services</title>
</head><body>==== Listening Services ====<br/>
Identify all the network services offered by the target machine. This may lead to the discovery of services not identified by initial scanning as well as the discovery of other machines and networks. The identification of services not shown in scanning can also provide information on possible filtering and control systems implemented in the network and/or host. In addition, the tester may be able to leverage these services to compromise other machines. Most operating system include a method of identifying TCP and UDP connections made to and from the machine. By checking both connections to and from a compromised machine it is possible to find relationships that were previously unknown. As well as the host the service should also be considered, this may reveal services listening on non-standard ports and indicate trust relationships such as keyless authentication for SSH.</body></html>
