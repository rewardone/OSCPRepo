</head><body>==== Neighbors ====<br/>
In todays network many services and operating systems use a number of protocols for neighbor discovery in an effort make the access of services, troubleshooting and configuration more convenient. Protocols vary depending on the type of target host. Networking equipment may use protocols like CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol) and LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) to identify systems, configurations and other details to hosts directly connected to them or present in the same subnet. Similarly, desktop and server operating systems may use protocols like mDNS (Multicast Domain Name Service) and NetBios to find details of hosts and services in the same subnet.</body></html>
