<title>File/Printer Shares</title>
</head><body>==== File/Printer Shares ====<br/>
File and print servers often contain targeted data or provide an opportunity to further penetrate the target network and hosts. The information that should be targeted includes:<br/>
*Shares offered by File Servers - Any file shares offered by target systems should be examined. Even just the names and comments of shares can leak important information about the names of internal applications or projects (i.e. if only "Fred" and "Christine" have access to the "Accounting" folder, perhaps they are both accounting employees).<br/>
*Access Control Lists and permissions for shares. - From the client side, if it is possible to connect to the share, then it should be checked to see if the connection is read/only or read/write. Remember that if a share contains directories then different permissions may apply to different directories. From the server side both server configuration and file/directory permissions should be examined.<br/>
*File share file and content listings<br/>
*Identify files of interest from the file share listings. Look for interesting or targeted items such as:<br/>
**Source Code<br/>
**Backups<br/>
**Installation Files<br/>
**Confidential Data (financial data in spreadsheets, bank reports in TXT/PDF, password files, etc.)<br/>
*Place trojans or autorun files - Using clever naming, or by mimicking naming conventions already in use, users can be encouraged to execute these payloads, allowing the tester to further penetrate the network. If file server logs can be obtained, specific users may even be targeted.</body></html>
