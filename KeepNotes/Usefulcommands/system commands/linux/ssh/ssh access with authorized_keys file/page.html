<title>SSH Access with AUTHORIZED_KEYS file</title>
</head><body>COPY THE KEY TO A SERVER<br/>
<br/>
Once an SSH key has been created, the <span style="font-size: 10pt">ssh-copy-id</span>&nbsp;command can be used to install it as an authorized key on the server. Once the key has been authorized for SSH, it grants access to the server without a password.<br/>
This logs into the server host, and copies keys to the server, and configures them to grant access by adding them to the authorized_keys file. The copying may ask for a password or other authentication for the server.<br/>
<b>Only the public key is copied to the server.</b>&nbsp;The private key should never be copied to another machine.<br/>
<br/>
Use a command like the following to copy SSH key:<br/>
<br/>
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/mykey.pub user@host<br/>
or<br/>
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@123.45.56.78 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh &amp;&amp; cat &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
AUTHORIZED_KEYS<br/>
Configures permanent access using SSH keys<br/>
Configured separately for each user<br/>
Default location: /home/&lt;user&gt;/.ssh/authorized_keys<br/>
Default name: authorized_keys or authorized_keys2<br/>
Each line contains a SSH public key</body></html>
