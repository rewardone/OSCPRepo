<title>Run</title>
</head><body>schtasks run<br/>
Starts a scheduled task immediately. The run operation ignores the schedule, but uses the program file location, user account, and password saved in the task to run the task immediately.<br/>
<br/>
Syntax<br/>
schtasks /run /tn TaskName [/s Computer [/u [Domain**\]User [/p** Password]]]<br/>
<br/>
Parameters<br/>
/tn TaskName<br/>
Required. Identifies the task.<br/>
/s Computer<br/>
Specifies the name or IP address of a remote computer (with or without backslashes). The default is the local computer.<br/>
/u [Domain\]User<br/>
Runs this command with the permissions of the specified user account. By default, the command runs with the permissions of the current user of the local computer.<br/>
<br/>
Copy<br/>
The specified user account must be a member of the Administrators group on the remote computer. The **/u** and **/p** parameters are valid only when you use **/s**.<br/>
/p Password<br/>
Specifies the password of the user account specified in the /u parameter. If you use the /u parameter, but omit the /p parameter or the password argument, Schtasks prompts you for a password.<br/>
<br/>
Copy<br/>
The **/u** and **/p** parameters are valid only when you use **/s**.<br/>
/?<br/>
Displays help at the command prompt.<br/>
Remarks<br/>
Use this operation to test your tasks. If a task does not run, check the Task Scheduler Service transaction log, Systemroot\SchedLgU.txt, for errors.<br/>
<br/>
Running a task does not affect the task schedule and does not change the next run time scheduled for the task.<br/>
<br/>
To run a task remotely, the task must be scheduled on the remote computer. When you run it, the task runs only on the remote computer. To verify that a task is running on a remote computer, use Task Manager or the Task Scheduler transaction log, Systemroot\SchedLgU.txt.<br/>
<br/>
Examples<br/>
To run a task on the local computer<br/>
The following command starts the "Security Script" task.<br/>
<br/>
schtasks /run /tn "Security Script"<br/>
<br/>
In response, SchTasks.exe starts the script associated with the task and displays the following message:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Copy<br/>
SUCCESS: Attempted to run the scheduled task "Security Script".<br/>
As the message implies, Schtasks tries to start the program, but it cannot very that the program actually started.<br/>
<br/>
To run a task on a remote computer<br/>
The following command starts the Update task on a remote computer, Svr01:<br/>
<br/>
schtasks /run /tn Update /s Svr01<br/>
<br/>
In this case, SchTasks.exe displays the following error message:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Copy<br/>
ERROR: Unable to run the scheduled task "Update".<br/>
To find the cause of the error, look in the Scheduled Tasks transaction log, C:\Windows\SchedLgU.txt on Svr01. In this case, the following entry appears in the log:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Copy<br/>
"Update.job" (update.exe) 3/26/2001 1:15:46 PM ** ERROR **<br/>
The attempt to log on to the account associated with the task failed, therefore, the task did not run.<br/>
The specific error is:<br/>
0x8007052e: Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password.<br/>
Verify that the task's Run-as name and password are valid and try again.<br/>
Apparently, the user name or password in the task is not valid on the system. The following schtasks /change command updates the user name and password for the Update task on Svr01:<br/>
<br/>
**schtasks /change /tn Update /s Svr01 /ru Administrator /rp PassW@rd3**<br/>
<br/>
After the change command completes, the run command is repeated. This time, the Update.exe program starts and SchTasks.exe displays the following message:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Copy<br/>
SUCCESS: Attempted to run the scheduled task "Update".<br/>
As the message implies, Schtasks tries to start the program, but it cannot very that the program actually started.</body></html>
