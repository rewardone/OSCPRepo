<title>Diskshadow</title>
</head><body>DiskShadow.exe is a tool that exposes the functionality offered by the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS). By default, DiskShadow uses an interactive command interpreter similar to that of DiskRAID or DiskPart. DiskShadow also includes a scriptable mode.<br/>
<br/>
Note<br/>
Membership in the local Administrators group, or equivalent, is the minimum required to run DiskShadow.<br/>
<br/>
For examples of how to use DiskShadow commands, see Examples.<br/>
<br/>
Syntax<br/>
For interactive mode, type the following at the command prompt to start the DiskShadow command interpreter:<br/>
diskshadow<br/>
<br/>
For script mode, type the following, where script.txt is a script file containing DiskShadow commands:<br/>
diskshadow -s script.txt<br/>
<br/>
DiskShadow commands<br/>
