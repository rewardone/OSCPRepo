</head><body>Some mount flags to be aware of <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
noexec<br/>
Do not allow direct execution of any binaries on the mounted filesystem. (Until recently it was possible to run binaries anyway using a command like /lib/ld*.so /mnt/binary. This trick fails since Linux 2.4.25 / 2.6.0.)<br/>
$ /lib/ld-linux.so.2 ~/id<br/>
uid=1001(edd) gid=1001(edd) groups=1001(edd),1002(wheel)<br/>
<br/>
nodev<br/>
Do not interpret character or block special devices on the file system.<br/>
<br/>
exec<br/>
Permit execution of binaries.<br/>
<br/>
auto<br/>
Can be mounted with the -a option.<br/>
<br/>
noauto<br/>
Can only be mounted explicitly (i.e., the -a option will not cause the filesystem to be mounted).<br/>
<br/>
suid<br/>
Allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits to take effect.<br/>
<br/>
nosuid<br/>
Do not allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits to take effect. (This seems safe, but is in fact rather unsafe if you have suidperl(1) installed.)<br/>
<br/>
owner<br/>
Allow an ordinary (i.e., non-root) user to mount the filesystem if he is the owner of the device. This option <b>implies the options nosuid and nodev</b>&nbsp;(unless overridden by subsequent options, as in the option line owner,dev,suid).<br/>
<br/>
group<br/>
Allow an ordinary (i.e., non-root) user to mount the filesystem if one of his groups matches the group of the device. This option <b>implies the options nosuid and nodev</b>&nbsp;(unless overridden by subsequent options, as in the option line group,dev,suid).<br/>
<br/>
user<br/>
Allow an ordinary user to mount the filesystem. The name of the mounting user is written to mtab so that he can unmount the filesystem again. This option <b>implies the options noexec, nosuid, and nodev</b>&nbsp;(unless overridden by subsequent options, as in the option line user,exec,dev,suid).<br/>
<br/>
nouser<br/>
Forbid an ordinary (i.e., non-root) user to mount the filesystem. This is the default.<br/>
<br/>
users<br/>
Allow every user to mount and unmount the filesystem. This option <b>implies the options noexec, nosuid, and nodev</b>&nbsp;(unless overridden by subsequent options, as in the option line users,exec,dev,suid).<br/>
