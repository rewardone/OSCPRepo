# The Open Penetration Testing Bookmarks Collection #

...is just that, a collection of handy bookmarks initially collected and stored on google code that has aid me in my day to day work or I find in the course of research. They are not all inclusive and some sections need to be parsed but they are all good reference materials. I find having this Hackery folder in Firefox an easy way to reference syntax, tricks, methods, and generally facilitate and organize research.

Opening it up to everyone will facilitate a knowledge transfer.  Hopefully the initial set will grow and expand.

## Who?: ##

Initially started by [Jason Haddix](http://twitter.com/#!/jhaddix), Director of Penetration Testing at HP Fortify but I noticed that the project had been abandoned for some time so I ([Kurobeats](https://github.com/Kurobeats)) figured I'd get the thing going again.

**Work and contributions by:**

## How it's working at the moment: ##

First off, we need help. OCD organizational people and people who can contribute or sort out the best links. I've migrated the project from a Firefox bookmark html to a markdown page on github to allow for easy forking/collaboration.

## How to submit your bookmarks: ##

Since this is a github repo, just fork, add and submit a pull request. If you're new to github, check out the process [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

Try to ensure your submissions are of high quality.

## The general categories are: ##

**Forums:**

Created for forums that will help in both tool usage, syntax, attack techniques, and collection of scripts and tools. Needs some help. I don't really frequent too many underground forums but I actually find nice one-off scripts and info I can roll into my own code in these places. Would like to add more.

**Blogs Worth It:**

What the title says. There are a LOT of pentesting blogs, these are the ones I monitor constantly and value in the actual day to day testing work.

**OSINT Sites:**

OSINT has become a hug part of the pentest methodology. From fueling social engineering, to passively profiling your target infrastructure. There are subfolders for Presentaions on how-to, sites for profiling people and organizations, ans sites for profiling technical assets.

**Exploits and Advisories**

Places to go for exploit descriptions, white-papers, and code.

**Exploitation Intro**

If you'd like to get into exploit development, these are really the guides and docs that will start you off in the right direction.

**Agile Hacking**

Mostly collections of guides on non-tool command line hacking syntax. Heavily inspired by Ed Skoudis and PDP of GNUCitizen.

**Cheatsheets and fu!**

Random cheatsheets for heavily used tools and reference.

**`*`nix <3**

Collection of `*`nix command line knowledge and distributions for pentesting.

**Training/Classes**

Open source classes relating to hacking and penetration testing.

**Methodologies**

Some practical and some high level methodologies for hacking related activities.

**Labs**

If you want to practice your fu, these links to test sites, blogs about practice, and lab setup-how to's will help.

**Tools**

Semi-parsed, nor has it really been inspected for relevancy.

**Web Vectors**

I do a lot of web stuff. Here are some web vectors and associated useful docs and cheatsheets on each of them. Could always use more in these sections.

**Misc Sec**

Not categorized, misc, and randomness.

**MiTM**

It's not even parsed yet, nor has it really been inspected for relevancy.

**Hacker Media**

Needs additions to main pages of con video archives.
